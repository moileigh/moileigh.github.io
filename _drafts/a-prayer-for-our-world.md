I keep forgetting how big the world is

and the chaotic things that are happening in it.

There are people in danger right now.

People who have had to leave their worlds behind

and don’t know what to do.

People dying without having learned of God’s love.


Oh, Abba, Stop the wars.

Heal the people.

Thy will be done here on earth –

starting with me.


Show me what You want me to do.

Show me what You want me to let go of

and stop doing.

Show me what to say. What to shout.

What to write. How to help.


Help me want to get involved

instead of just curling up on a couch with a book.

  
There are so many battles going on –

physical, political, familial, spiritual –

all around the world.

It’s overwhelming.

So I give this whole world to You to hold.

You created it.

You cherish it.

  
I’m sorry for what we’ve done with it.

I’m sorry for my part

in the agony.

Forgive me.

Cleanse me and make me whiter than fresh-fallen snow

and show me what you want me to do

with my time

with my talent

with my energy

with my right now

for my world.


What can I do?


I can whisper of Hope.

* This too shall pass.
* Hope.


* Help is on the way.


* Keep fighting.


* Keep looking.


* Keep standing.


* Don’t give up. Don’t give in.


I can listen

* To the stories pouring in


* of people taking a solid stand


* against tyranny


* against injustice


* against hatred or bigotry,


* To the tales of anguish and sorrow,


* and loss and disappointment,


* of letting go of heart-held dreams.


* Tell us your stories.


* Share your anguish.


* You are heard!


I can shout of Love.

* The Creator God has not left you.


* No matter what you’ve done


* No matter what’s been done to you.


* He is there.


* He sees.


* He knows.


* He cares.


* Justice will be done – in Love.


* with Peace as the Final Outcome.


I can encourage you

* to step forward and do what You were made to do.


* Find your passion.
* Share your dream.


* See the needs around you.


* Find the hole you were created to fill -- 


* and fill it.


I can dance

* In the anticipation and exultation


* of Certain Knowledge


* that lost loved ones


* are in the arms of Jesus!


* In the Joy


* of being known,


* accepted,


* chosen and cherished,


* useful


* and needed


* by the God who stops the tsunamis


* with a whispered word


* of Peace.


* In the quiet assurance


* that God is somehow weaving beauty


* out of our broken chaos.


I can pray.

  
So today

I am stopping my crazy, busy living

to sit by the window,

with a cat on my lap,

and pray for our world…
