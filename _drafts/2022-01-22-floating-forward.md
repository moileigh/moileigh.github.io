I need to compare me to Me.

To grow and get better.

To daily draw closer to the me I want to be.

To the me

God created me to be.

And to God.

I need to stop trying to be who I think people want me to be.

That’s why I like being alone –

I can hear my own voice

Over the noise of others.

There have been a lot of changes these past few years

And I forgot where to go

to be relieved and refreshed.

Adjusting to the new normal,

I kind of treaded water through the years.

Adjusting behaviors according to current protocols…

Avoiding contact…

Comparing my boat to the ones my neighbors are struggling in…

Trying not to sink…

My eyes have been on the wind and the waves.

And not on their Creator

Who simply whispers, “Be still!”

This time, He’s not speaking to the wind and the waves.

The storm continues raging around me.

Me, in my little, rocking boat.

But my heart calms.

My fears fade.

And I continue sailing.

Just a little bit better…
