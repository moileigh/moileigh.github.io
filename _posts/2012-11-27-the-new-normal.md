<div>
  I’ve written about that a lot.
</div>

<div>
  It’s the way life begins again after all of the pieces of your broken world settle down around you and you slowly learn to navigate around the new landmarks of your life. It usually seems way too soon, but in God’s perfect timing it never really is.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  I had to find a new normal when my parents felt the call to serve God as missionaries when I was 9.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  And again when I graduated high school and came back stateside for college. Oh – and the biggest adjustment – when I got my goose. I always said that I found him in a Happy Meal – but really, He was a gift from God that got me off a downward train and got me chasing Him.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Cancer diagnosis and treatment left me with a new normal – a life with a few more aches and pains and a strong awareness of just how fragile I really am, and just how strong, dependably loving, and personal God is.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  And now.
</div>

<div>
  I’m beginning a new normal. Life with a Grammy Up There instead of a grammy down here.
</div>

<div>
  <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>We used to call her Close Grammy because she lived here in Massachusetts. Mom’s mom, Faraway Grammy, lived in Illinois, a two-days drive from us. We visited her on holidays, and saw her on Sundays. Then when we moved to Africa, we’d sometimes stay at her house when we came home.
</div>

<div>
  After the goose was born, she really was a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">close</i> Grammy, always making sure my house was clean and filling BJs shopping carts with diapers for me. We had supper at her house every Wednesday night before AWANA and sat with her at church…
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Sigh. I’m going to miss her. But I’m smiling as I type this. Because I’m just making the connection. She’s beginning her new normal, too. And I can only imagine what it’s like. Tea time in the library with the King of Kings. Long walks in the garden with her mother. Maybe a dance or two with Grampa before settling into a comfy chair with a good puzzle. All in the presence of her loving Creator. LIFE will be Good!
