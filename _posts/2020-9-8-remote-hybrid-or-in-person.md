Today was day six of professional development and training before our school year officially starts. My district has chosen to use a hybrid model for K-3 students, and a remote model for 4th grade and up. It&#39;s been (and still is!!!) a HUGE learning curve for all stakeholders as we explore the different learning management platforms, get trained over video conferencing apps, and create new day-to-day expectations for students and adults.

At the same time, we&#39;re setting up our classrooms so that the students are physically distant but still motivated to learn, participate, and achieve. Today I stuck footprints to the floor to show students where to stand when lining up (yes, the line now goes around two sides of the room!), I attended a webinar on creating on-line content for the remote half of my class, I finished the first module of a course on remote learning created by the state department of education, I created a series of activities to assess students&#39; sight word skills via their ipads, I took an epipen training (because epipens will now be kept in classrooms to reduce nurse visits), and I got caught up on my email. Well, most of my emails…

I have to admit, I&#39;m very nervous about having the children back in school. But that&#39;s not what this blog is about. I know there are many pros and many cons to in-person learning right now, and I&#39;m grateful that it&#39;s not my decision to make. But I am nervous.

This year is going to be very, very different.

>I won&#39;t be able to hug my little ones and slap them high five in the morning.

>I won&#39;t be able to pull up a chair and work side by side with them.

>I won&#39;t be able to hold their hands in the hallway or at recess, or pat them on the shoulder as I pass their desk.

>And wearing that mask ALL DAY LONG? I can still feel it on my nose when I crawl into bed at night…

Sigh. Deep breath – in through the nose, out through the mouth (much easier to do without the mask on!). It won&#39;t be all bad.

>I will be able to meet my new little ones face-to-face, mask-to-mask, in-person.

>I will be able to differentiate their learning using technology and work with them in smaller groups.

>I will be able to model kindness, perseverance, and the ability to learn while having fun even in tough situations.

>I will be able to connect with my little ones and remind them how smart, how brave, how loved, how unique, and how amazing they are.

Because I&#39;m a teacher. Whether remote, hybrid, or in-person. We&#39;ve got this!

(But I will miss the hugs!)
