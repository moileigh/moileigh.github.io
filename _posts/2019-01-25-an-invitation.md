<p><span style="color: #003300;">I was lost in thought for a bit the other day, and this is where I found myself...</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #003300;">I was pondering the aches and pains of life. But gratefully &ndash; because of God&rsquo;s promise that all would work out for good somehow. Somewhen. And I realized that I didn&rsquo;t need to know what was coming next or what would happen down the road because I already know how it will all end.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #003300;">Christ will return. Every knee will bow. I&rsquo;ll finally get to go home.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #003300;">But then the realization hit me anew and again: that&rsquo;s not the end.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #003300;">That&rsquo;s only going to be the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #003300;">And for a moment my heart danced with joy at the thought of entering a joyful and glorious eternity with my God, my child, my parents, my friends &ndash;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #003300;">But the dancing stopped as a calm but very quiet voice asked, &ldquo;Will all your loved ones be making this beautiful new start with you?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #003300;">I sat in silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #003300;">Yes. I know that all things will work out for good for those who love Him and are called according to His purpose. But what about the others? Is that why Jesus wept?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #003300;">So my job now, while it is day, while I have breath, while my hand can hold a pen, is to keep issuing the greatest invitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #003300;">You&rsquo;re invited to eternity. Your ticket has been purchased &ndash; at a tremendous price. Your presence is requested by the King.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #003300;">Will you please join us?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #003300;">&nbsp;</span></p>
