<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  I love these days.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  These moments.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  These simple times when I stop running around doing and sit down long enough to listen.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  Lately my life has been quite out of balance. Work has taken over – which is normal this time of year, but never easy. And this year seems worse. With 27 little ones (up from 23 last year) my paper grading time has increased by about half an hour a day. My planning time has also increased as I try to figure out who needs what when and away from whom… I also doesn’t help that we were unable to purchase workbooks this year, and that we’re rewriting the math and ela curriculum as we teach, to align them with the common core. And that the photocopier is broken. Again.

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  And then there’s the actual teaching. I can’t remember any of my undergrad courses covering how to teach science to 27 curious kittens spanning six grade levels in ability, each bringing their own painful baggage to the table…

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  Sigh.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  But none of that today!
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  Because today God’s whisper is breaking through.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  “Breath. Walk. Listen.”
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  Life is not about getting everything done.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  It’s not about getting every paper graded and passed back the next day (month?).
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  Somedays, life is simply about sleeping in. Eating cider donuts and playing Pandora radio in pjs.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  Refreshing. Refocusing. Rebooting.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  Remembering.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  I’m not really here to teach children how to read. That’s simply something I do for fun.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  I’m here to bask in the love of my Abba, and to reflect that love back to you.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  How about you?
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  Why are you here?
</div>
