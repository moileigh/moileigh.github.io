**Here's an old one that I found saved in a file labeled 'Scribbles'**

I&#39;m tired.  
I&#39;m wordless.
The busyness of the days is heavy. 

I can&#39;t just write it down  
And watch the fears,  
worries,  
sorrows  
Drip away with the drying ink.

Today they&#39;re too real.  
They&#39;re too heavy  
too clingy  
Too all absorbing and mind-numbing.  
Too Life-Interfering.  
I&#39;ve forgotten the taste of peace.

It&#39;s like trying to force a poem to rhyme.  
Carefully creating the perfect meter  
with counted cadence and crafted chorus.  

But it doesn&#39;t come to life.  
It doesn&#39;t really mean anything.

Empty words on an overfilled page.  
A day filled to the brim  
With meaningless actions.  
Words without Faith are dead.

But in the busyness  
The soft voice still whispers to those who will listen.  
&quot;Be still.  
Wait on the breath of life.&quot;

The dry bones stir.  
The empty words, edited, rattle with hope.
