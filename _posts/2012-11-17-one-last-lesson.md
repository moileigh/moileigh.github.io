Today I had what might be my last lesson on prayer from my grandmother.
  
She&#8217;s the matriarch of the Nelson family. The glue that holds the four grands and six greats together. The prayer warrior who intercedes for all of her loved one&#8217;s loved ones.

But she&#8217;s tired.
  
So I told her that I would let her go. But that I would miss her prayers. And she began to teach me how to pray.

&#8220;God will give you the words,&#8221; she promised. &#8220;He&#8217;ll tell you who to pray for in each moment. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a quick whisper. And don&#8217;t be afraid to not pray for someone else &#8211; God will keep them covered. Listen. He will talk with you.&#8221; Then her eyes grew grave, &#8220;Pray for the little ones. Pray that God will send His guardian angels to shelter them from the evil one.&#8221;

She then told me that she didn&#8217;t want to lay a prayer burden on me.
  
And she didn&#8217;t. She just passed on a torch.
  
It&#8217;s my turn to step up to the plate.
  
Or, rather, to kneel on the mat.

Love you, Grammy!
