**Because tomorrow is the first day of school and I&#39;m way too tired to actually write anything new, here&#39;s something I&#39;ve been working on.**

**To the tune of Be Our Guest (yes, from Beauty and the Beast)**

Wear a mask,  
Wear a mask,  
Let&#39;s put Corona in the past.  
It&#39;s not exactly comfortable,  
but is it too much to ask?

Cover your mouth,  
keep your germs.  
There are no other terms.  
We&#39;re not trying to take your freedom.  
It&#39;s not the Battle of Antietam.

Cover up.  
Stop the spread.  
Keep your germs by your own head.  
It&#39;s kind of like wearing a pair of pants.  
Your mask is not for you -  
it&#39;s for us others, too,  
so wear a mask,  
wear a mask,  
wear a mask!

Woven cloth,  
clear plastic shield,  
find a covering you can wield  
when your within six feet  
of another human being.

On inside  
every store  
Take it off when you get home.  
Follow the guides while we&#39;re complaining  
and we can make that curve start waning.

With a mask  
you can still breath  
when you wear it properly  
with your mouth and nose tucked safely underneath.  
While a bit uncomfortable,  
it beats a respirator.

So wear a mask,  
If your sick  
Staying home will do the trick.  
Wear a mask,  
wear a mask,  
Wear a mask!
