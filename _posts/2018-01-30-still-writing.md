So I’ve had a lot of people ask me what my next book will be about. I love that people expect there to be a next one. There will be – I still have so much left to say.

But what will it be about?

Well, one idea is to write a fiction book about a first year teacher. Over my years in a classroom, I’ve collected a few stories that people outside of the classroom might find a tad bit surprising. You teachers know what I’m talking about. Just at lunch today we were taking about the time a I had a student swallow a penny during math class. I immediately sent him to the nurse who emptied his pockets and took all of his money. He came back, sat down, and took off his shoe. Pulling out another penny, he calmly said, “She didn’t take this one,” as he put it into his mouth. I’ve got lots of stories like that which might make for a fun book.

I also still want to do something with my son’s journal from the two weeks he spent on the streets in Lynn. I learned a lot from that experience and I would like to share it. Oh – and I want to write a children’s book that I can share with my students.

There are so many ideas and so many blank pages to fill with words.

Any suggestions?
