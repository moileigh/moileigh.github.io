<p>Abba,</p>
<p>Teach me to hear Your heartbeat.</p>
<p>To remember Your love.</p>
<p>Unconditional.</p>
<p>Undeserved.</p>
<p>Unlimited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If only I could get out of my own way</p>
<p>And bask in You.</p>
<p>All my petty worries would fade away.</p>
<p>My small life could grow meaningful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what we&rsquo;re all seeking?</p>
<p>Meaning?</p>
<p>Meaning and acclaim.</p>
<p>Attention.</p>
<p>The promise that we won&rsquo;t be forgotten.</p>
<p>The assurance that we&rsquo;re important.</p>
<p>That we mean something.</p>
<p>Meaning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re insignificant.</p>
<p>We are dust motes in a beautiful universe.</p>
<p>Meaningless,</p>
<p>dtrifting dust motes</p>
<p>That You&rsquo;ve chosen to love.</p>
<p>Unconditionally.</p>
<p>Undeservingly.</p>
<p>Unlimitedly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am nothing.</p>
<p>Yet You have given me EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>I am worthless.</p>
<p>Yet You have paid the greatest price</p>
<p>to ensure my place beside You</p>
<p>for an eternity.</p>
<p>I am not even a minor player in the great story.</p>
<p>Yet You wrote it just for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How often I forget this.</p>
<p>How often I forget my own unimportance</p>
<p>and try to make myself great.</p>
<p>I want to rewrite my story so that it&rsquo;s all about me.</p>
<p>My joy and pleasure.</p>
<p>My health.</p>
<p>My safety.</p>
<p>My needs.</p>
<p>My wants.</p>
<p>My demands.</p>
<p>Myself.</p>
<p>I exhaust myself in my strivings</p>
<p>for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When all I really have to do</p>
<p>is sit back and rest in You.</p>
<p>Because</p>
<p>as overwhelming and unthinkable as it is</p>
<p>You love me.</p>
<p>Unconditionally.</p>
<p>Undeservedly.</p>
<p>Unlimitedly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will meet my needs.</p>
<p>You care about my wants.</p>
<p>My health.</p>
<p>My hopes and dreams.</p>
<p>You taught my heart how to love,</p>
<p>my eyes how to see,</p>
<p>my ears how to hear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for now</p>
<p>I will sit, see, and listen.</p>
<p>Abba,</p>
<p>teach me how to hear Your heartbeat.</p>
