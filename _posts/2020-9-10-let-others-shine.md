**Note: This one should be read outloud.**

I am not diminished  
when other people shine

Instead  
when I help them  
become their best  
I also become better  
in the process

I will  
Stop competing  
Start cooperating  
Start championing  
Stop comparing

I will  
Reach out  
Touch  
Embrace  
Enjoy  
Celebrate

I will  
Give  
without thought of getting  
Listen  
without interruption  
Hold the light steady  
so someone else can see clearly  
so someone else  
can be seen clearly

I will  
Shout out their successes  
Clap for their achievements  
Whistle, cheer, and happy dance  
knowing  
that sometimes they can win  
without me losing  
because we&#39;re not always competing

Often  
we&#39;re not even playing the same game

Telling someone how great they are  
does not lesson the awesomeness  
of me

Because I am awesome

I will be better today  
then I was yesterday  
and we can both shine  
together
