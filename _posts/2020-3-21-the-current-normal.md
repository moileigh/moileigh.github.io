Title: The Current Normal

<p ><span >The current normal.</span></p>
<p >
  <br>
</p>
<p ><span >I refuse to call this the new normal, because I know that someday this fear and isolation will fade away and we’ll all slip back into our old ruts. We’ll eventually use up the stock-piled toilet paper. We’ll return to hugging friends and shaking hands with strangers. Humans are hardwired to need touch and physical contact. We’ll also go back to eating in restaurants, learning in large groups, and playing sports. The way we are living now is not the new normal. It’s just a temporary set of maneuvers in a battle.</span></p>
<p >
  <br>
</p>
<p ><span >But it hasn’t been easy…</span></p>
<p >
  <br>
</p>
<p ><span >On day one of my social isolation for the good of humanity, I finished my book. Then I finished my puzzle. On day two, I finished another book and another puzzle, and then snuck out to get Chinese food. On day three I finished yet another book. I texted every friend in my phonebook. Then I broke my 76 day fast from TV and binge watched my favorite show. And speaking of binging, I’ve made quite a dent in my snackpile…</span></p>
<p >
  <br>
</p>
<p ><span >While I absolutely love sleeping in every morning, I miss the sense of purpose that getting up and going to work gave me. I miss the smiles and hugs of my students, and planning with my colleagues. I miss teaching a difficult lesson in a simple way and seeing the I-get-it light bulb brighten the classroom…</span></p>
<p >
  <br>
</p>
<p ><span >But none of that is a part of my current (and temporary) normal.</span></p>
<p >
  <br>
</p>
<p ><span >I’m here. It’s now. And this is what I’m called to do. To self-isolate and to wait.</span></p>
<p >
  <br>
</p>
<p ><span >So, I’m finding a new routine and gouging out a new rut. I’m staying connected with friends and with loved ones. I’m posting videos and lessons in a Google Classroom for the students and parents who want something to fill their waiting. And I’m spending extra time just being still with Abba. He knows all about waiting.</span></p>
<p >
  <br>
</p>
<p ><span >So my challenge for you: Make a new a rut. Find a purpose. Cling to, and wait on Abba. Find a way to thrive in the current normal, while knowing that it is temporary.</span></p>
<p >
  <br>
</p>
<p ><span >Yes, the world will look a little different when all of this is over. Hard times change people. But maybe we’ll be so grateful to be back together that we’ll be able to focus on the positives.</span></p>
<p >
  <br>
</p>
<p ><span >In the meantime, I pray you all are well. Please contact me if there’s any way I can help you as you muddle through the current normal. Know that you’re not alone in your isolation and please reach out to someone when you’re feeling lonely. If we stick together, we can handle this time apart.</span></p>
