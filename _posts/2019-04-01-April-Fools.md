<p>Scrolling through Facebook, I noticed that seven years ago today I was able to pet a kangaroo at a Sharks&rsquo; game. Eight years ago I had a snow day. Two years ago today I posted a picture of a white wonderland outside on April 1. Today seemed simple and quiet compared to each of those. There was a little ice on the wetland this morning, but none on the windshield and no snow on the ground&hellip;</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s crew of second graders seemed mostly unfamiliar with the concept of April Fool&rsquo;s Day. A couple of them told jokes but there were no pranks like I&rsquo;ve had in the past. Maybe it&rsquo;s going out of style. One year I had a student come in to school with a leg brace on saying that he&rsquo;d broken his leg. Other years there were simple pranks and lots of jokes, but not this year. Well, other than my brownies...</p>
<p>I made &lsquo;brownies&rsquo; again this year, carefully cutting brown construction paper into capital E&rsquo;s and tucking them into an aluminum pan covered with foil. Just before the phonics lesson, I told my students that I&rsquo;d made them &lsquo;brownies&rsquo; and for some reason, they immediately suspected a trick. One even looked right at me and said, &ldquo;No sir!&rdquo; So I went to my desk and lifted up the pan. Their eyes grew wide and their jaws dropped. I carried the pan over to them, carefully peeled back the covering, reached in, and pulled out a brown e. Then I began passing them out.</p>
<p>They were not happy with me.</p>
<p>It's tough when reality doesn't meet our expectations. When someone we trust lets us down. When we set our hopes on one thing and end up with something quite different.</p>
<p>One little one put her hands on her hips and said that she was very mad at me (but she <em>was</em> smiling as she said it). Another refused to even accept a brown e. However, when I pointed out that they could use their &lsquo;brownie&rsquo; on someone else, they perked up a little bit. Apparently they agree that it&rsquo;s much more fun to be the perpetrator than the recipient. Everyone who entered my classroom for the rest of the day was offered a &lsquo;brownie&rsquo;. I have the feeling that several parents and siblings were also offered a handmade treat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do want to point out that all of the students did fully forgive me when I pulled out a bag of Keebler double stuffed fudge cookies, though they made me open it and show them the cookies inside before they got too excited again.</p>
<p>But I think the best part of the day was about a half hour later when one of my little ones suddenly shouted out in the middle of a phonics lesson, &ldquo;I get it! It&rsquo;s a brown E!&rdquo;</p>
