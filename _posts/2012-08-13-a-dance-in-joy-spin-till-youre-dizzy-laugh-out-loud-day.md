<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  Today was a butterfly day.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  A dance in joy, spin till youâ€™re dizzy, laugh out loud day.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  One of those days that leaves your soul calmly knowing that Life Is Good.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  What was so good about it? Actually, Iâ€™m not entirely sure. I think itâ€™s just one of those things where the whole is so much greater than the sum of its parts.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; tab-stops: 84.75pt;">
  <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span>
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  So here are the parts:
</div>

  * <span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">Â·<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span>I woke up to hugs from Mom and Dad as they left on their road trip
  * <span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">Â·<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span>I wore a new dress
  * <span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">Â·<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span>I had a honey barbecue chicken sandwich and a pineapple chiller for lunch
  * <span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">Â·<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span>I bought an iPad with a pretty pink case
  * <span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">Â·<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span>I got to watch the raindrops run up my windshield on the way home
  * <span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">Â·<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span>I had a text chat with my son (as he scolded me for wasting money on a pretty pink case)
  * <span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">Â·<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span>I finished reading another chapter in a book

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  Looking back over that list, Iâ€™m grinning ear to ear but youâ€™re probably not seeing a lot that will add up to much of anything. So, with a little more detail:
</div>

  * <span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">Â·<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span>Hugs â€“ my family doesnâ€™t do that much. So when we do, I treasure it.
  * <span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">Â·<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span>New dress â€“ it was actually a new-to-me dress that I bought super cheap at Savers, but from the compliments I got today, I felt like I was wearing â€“ well, something not super cheap.
  * <span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">Â·<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span>Honey barbecue chicken sandwich with pineapple chiller â€“ that is my third favorite food of all time. Second is the broccoli, cheddar chicken that Cracker Barrel makes on Wednesdays. First is a plate of fries smothered in that sweet red sauce made in that little restaurant by the pool in Bouakeâ€¦
  * <span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">Â·<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span>iPad â€“ admit it, youâ€™d be smiling, too.
  * <span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">Â·<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span>Raindrops â€“ this one is two-fold. First, I love rain. This probably has something to do with those hot, dry, days (weeks, months, years???) in Bouake and the euphoria that comes with playing soccer in the mango rains. But also now that Iâ€™ve got RainX on my windshield, when Iâ€™m driving in the rain it looks like Iâ€™m going at warp speed with Spock and McKoy.
  * <span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">Â·<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span>Text chat with my son â€“ Yeah, â€˜nuff said there. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">Â </span>ðŸ˜€
  * <span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">Â·<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span>Finished chapter â€“ in a text book. For a doctoral class. Iâ€™m actually doing it. Iâ€™m actually going there. Dreams do come true.

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  Today was a great day.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  But I didnâ€™t even mention the greatest part.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  Today at church, I saw a hurting friend. I went over to her, hugged her, and whispered of my prayers. Later as I prayed for her, I thought about how those broken, empty, lonely moments are the times when we realize how much we need Godâ€™s solid, strong, saving love. Thatâ€™s when we cling to Him as He longs to be clung to.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  So often I wander off and do my own thing, buying dresses and iPads and reading books, eating honey barbecue chicken, and slowly drifting away from what I need most. What I only really know I need when my world is falling apart.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  And it felt so right to remember Him on a good day. On a not-falling-apart-day. On a puddle-jumping, giggling, didnâ€™t-even-realize-I-needed-Him day. Because I do. I always do.
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
  And Heâ€™s always thereâ€¦
</div>

<div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;">
