Today I&#39;m tired.

Actually, I&#39;ve been tired since somewhere in mid-August.

This whole surviving-a-pandemic thing is hard, no matter who you are or what you&#39;re supposed to be doing. Constantly being on the alert, trying to breathe somewhat normally through three layers of fabric, stopping to wipe the condensation off my glasses, and asking everyone to repeat everything three or four times â€“ it&#39;s draining.

But that&#39;s not all we&#39;re dealing with. We have to combine that with the regular, daily, aches, pains, and excitements of life, like getting up in the morning to drive to work, washing dishes, cooking meals, and putting away the laundry.

And on top of all that, life is still hurling out the whammies: cancer diagnoses, family members passing away, painful anniversaries, new babies.

Life is quite challenging right now.

So I have to ask. How are you?

Are you doing ok? Are you taking care of you? Are you still checking in with your friends and your neighbors? Are you getting out of the house for something other than a commute to work? Are you getting in some exercise?

Are you asking for help? My pastor mentioned that last one in his sermon on Sunday. It&#39;s ok to need help. It&#39;s ok to not be able to make ends meet or to not be able to keep things from totally unraveling on your own. We all have different strengths, different weaknesses, different resources, and different melting points. That&#39;s what makes life doable. We are here to help each other.

When I&#39;m melting down, you can offer me an ice cream cone. When it&#39;s your turn to melt down, I&#39;ll be here for you.

All you have to do is ask.

Together, we&#39;ve got this!
