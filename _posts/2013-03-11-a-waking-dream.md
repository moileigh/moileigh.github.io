<div style="background-color: white; color: #351c75; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">
  <span style="font-size: small;">I had a waking dream the other day. I was kneeling by my bed trying to pray and my mind began to wander…</span>
</div>

<div style="background-color: white; color: #351c75; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">
</div>

<div style="background-color: white; color: #351c75; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">
  <span style="font-size: small;">I had a mental picture of millions of people in a great throne room, all kneeling and still. “In that day every knee shall bow” flew gently through my mind. </span>
</div>

<div style="background-color: white; color: #351c75; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">
  <span style="font-size: small;">Then, as I knelt with the multitude, I noticed Jesus walking through, playing a Heavenly game of Seven-up. Gently tapping some on the shoulder, or resting his hand upon their head, but walking right by most. </span>
</div>

<div style="background-color: white; color: #351c75; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">
</div>

<div style="background-color: white; color: #351c75; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">
  <span style="font-size: small;">Then he stepped up to me and rested His hand on my head as he joyfully said, “You’re a friend. Come with me and enter paradise.” </span>
</div>

<div style="background-color: white; color: #351c75; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">
  <span style="font-size: small;">I rose joyously but I looked around at all those left kneeling with their heads hanging down – for the first time I looked around not proudfully, but sorrowfully.</span>
</div>

<div style="background-color: white; color: #351c75; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">
</div>

<div style="background-color: white; color: #351c75; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">
  <span style="font-size: small;">“Abba – is there any way? Is there anything I can do to bring these people, too?” I asked. </span>
</div>

<div style="background-color: white; color: #351c75; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">
  <span style="font-size: small;">He turned back and looked at me with such deep sorrow in His loving eyes. “It’s a shame you didn’t ask me that while you all still walked the Earth.”</span>
</div>

<div style="background-color: white; color: #351c75; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">
</div>

<div style="background-color: white; color: #351c75; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">
  <span style="font-size: small;">He turned from me, but still held me by the hand and drew me toward the door.</span>
</div>

<div style="background-color: white; color: #351c75; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">
  <span style="font-size: small;">I left the throne room with tears streaming from my eyes – but as I stepped into Paradise He turned back to me and wiped every tear away before leading me forward into unconditional, uncompromised, unending Joy.</span>
</div>
