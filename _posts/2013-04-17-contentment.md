<div>
  Yesterday, in the middle of my walk in closet, surround by not-quite-neatly folded clothes and cleaning supplies, I made a realization. Today, crawling through the dark caves at Purgatory Chasm and skidding on the ice at the bottom, I made it again.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  The realization? I am happy in my own skin.
</div>

<div>
   It’s been almost six years since I last said.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  A cancer diagnosis can have a tendency to stir up a feeling of discontent. A handful or two of scars and some removed chunks of skin can turn that discontent to loathing. Losing hair, and then body parts that you didn’t even know you valued can even lead to a touch of despair.

  <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>The slinking fear of recurrence hiding out in the deepest depths of your heart take a steady toll, too.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  All that compounded with constant exhaustion from chemo or radiation or surgery can leave you distrustful of the body you’ve been trapped in. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">If I go for a walk, will I have the energy to come home? Will I get sick if I eat that? Will I get sick if I don’t?</i>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Then, of course, there’s the wardrobe. Comfy sweaters are too scratchy for aching skin. Favorite jeans won’t fit over the extra pounds of chemo, or slide off because of the lost pounds. Fitted blouses don’t fit if you don’t have breasts. After each surgery, I never knew which clothes in my closet would fit.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  But somehow, today, all of that is meaningless again.
</div>

<div>
  Because once again, I am happy in my own skin.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Maybe it was the last surgery – I finally slipped close enough to normal to feel normal. Maybe it’s simply that Spring is here after a long, hard winter. Maybe Mom’s been praying for me again. Maybe God reached down and retuned my heart. Probably a combination of all of those. But it doesn’t really matter.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Once again, I don’t need to know the why.
</div>
