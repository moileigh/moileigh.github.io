<p >I promised myself that I would write 71 posts this year. &nbsp;</p>
<p >I did write a couple before getting swept up in the rapids of life, which have been extra rocky and rapid this year. I forgot all about that promise to myself. &nbsp;</p>
<p >Yesterday, my daughter texted me that I have 65 to go.</p>
<p >So here&rsquo;s post #7:</p>
<p ><br></p>
<p >&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing a great job. Keep up the hard work!&rdquo;</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >Yup. That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got to say. And that&rsquo;s ok.</p>
<p >Because sometimes it&rsquo;s ok to not have the words.</p>
<p >And sometimes it&rsquo;s ok to do the bare minimum.</p>
<p >Sometimes, it&rsquo;s even ok to stay in pj&rsquo;s and not wash your hair for three days in a row.</p>
<p >Or four&hellip;</p>
<p >But by day five you really need to take a look at your motives, because it might be time to climb back on that horse, get back in the game, jump back in the shower, or pick up that pen and post <em>something</em>. <em>Anything</em>. Just do enough to get that happy energy surge that comes from crossing something off a to-do list and making your daughter proud.&nbsp;</p>
<p >Just take that first step.</p>
<p >And then remind yourself, that no matter what you haven&rsquo;t gotten done yet &ndash; despite the dishes piled in the sink, despite the cat hair on the couch and the emails you haven&rsquo;t checked in a while &ndash; you got something done and you&rsquo;re doing ok.</p>
<p >Because you are.</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<p >You&rsquo;re doing a great job. Keep up the hard work!</p>
