Abba,
  
can I sleep at the foot of the cross tonight?
  
I know You&#8217;re not there.
  
I just like to remember
  
what You&#8217;ve done.
  
And I know I can&#8217;t stay.
  
I&#8217;m supposed to be out there
  
in the world
  
sharing you and showing others
  
the way here.
  
But for now
  
for tonight
  
can I rest at the foot of Your cross?
