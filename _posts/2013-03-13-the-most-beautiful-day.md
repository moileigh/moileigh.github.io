<div style="color: #660000;">
  Today has to be The Most Beautiful Day.
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
  I’m sitting in a rocking chair pulled up to the open sliding glass door. The sun is shining down on me, the gentle breeze is drying my hair from a late shower. The bird songs are blending with the songs from my phone. “You are all I need” fades into “Who Am I” and I just slowly rock, and enjoy.
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
  It’s day 9 after surgery.
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
  I survived the ‘just survive’ stage. I got through the ‘this was a huge mistake’ phase. And yesterday I dealt with the ‘I’ve just got to get out of this house!” stage by taking a walk by the dam and then stopping at the library to pick up a new pile of quarter books.
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
  My bandages are tight and uncomfortable, but not unbearably so. My remaining stitches aren’t itchy yet. My bruises have all faded to yellow and brown, and some have faded completely away.
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
  I am healing.
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
  And as I bask, rock, and listen, I realize that it’s not just a physical healing.
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
  I lean my head back, breathe deeply, and feel Peace.
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
  I am content.
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
  The first time I remove the bandages and look in the mirror after a surgery, my heart breaks.
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
  But by the 9<sup>th</sup> day, it’s not so bad.
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
  We won’t see the final results for about six months, when the swelling has all gone down, the stitches have dissolved, and the scars have faded.
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
  But for now, I am content.
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
  For now, breasts don’t matter.
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
  For now, cancer can’t hurt me.
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
  Because the sun is shining and the birds are singing.
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
  God is on His throne and all is right with my world.
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
</div>

<div style="color: #660000;">
  What is your Most Beautiful Day?
