It&#8217;s finished! Book three: Join Me In the Journey is finally ready to publish and will be available on Amazon in three to five business days. Here&#8217;s an except from the introduction:

_As I’m sitting here writing this book, I’m wishing you were sitting here with me. Wouldn’t it be nice to chat over a cup of hot chocolate and share our thoughts on life? To give and take, and grow, together? That’s the purpose of this book. It’s a chance to share, to reflect, and to grow._

_I wrote In His Hands to share about God’s goodness, grace, and love during my cancer journey, and to maybe take a bit of fear from the world. My second book, All Is Well, is a collection of the poems that came from that journey. After reading those books, a few people approached me and commented on my faith and how nice it was that I could have such peace._

_This book is an invitation._

_You can rest in His hands, too._

_For some reason, for some purpose, God carefully crafted us to be exactly who we are. Oh, we’re not done yet. I know I have a couple of corners that He’s still scrubbing at. Maybe you do, too?_

_But here we are, cherished and unique._

_For the next 31 days, let’s celebrate our uniqueness by reflecting on who we are, who God is, and why He made us. It’ll only take about 10 minutes a day&#8230;_

So, keep an eye out on Amazon! I can&#8217;t wait to hear what you think.
