I just wanted to take a moment to remind you that you are loved.

No matter what your past was, no matter what you make of your future, no matter where you are right now.  
You are loved.  

You are not a random alignment of cells and neurons, but a carefully crafted masterpiece. Your life is not a collection of coincidences and luck, but a sequenced event of divine opportunities and interventions.  
You are not just a miniscule speck in the vast cosmos. Instead, you are an integral part of the Creator&#39;s master plan.  
You are focused in His thoughts and centered in His heart.  
You are loved.

This love is not dependent on your own actions. This love is not determined by your own capacity for loving and receiving love. This love is not fickle and changing, and it will never fade. It will never be taken back. It will never go away.  
No matter what you&#39;ve done. No matter what you might do.  
No matter how hard you refuse to believe it.  
You are loved.

Beyond what you can ever imagine.  
Beyond what you can ever Hope for, Wish for, Dream of.  
You are loved.

Hold on to that during the darker days. Hold on to that in your angry, bitter moments. Hold on to that when those around you fail you and walk away. Cling to it when life hurts.  
You are loved.

And when life is beautiful and the sun shines brightly, when life seems perfect and you can almost grasp the depth of His love, turn around and pass on the reminder to someone else.  
Because they are loved, too.
