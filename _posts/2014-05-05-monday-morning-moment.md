As I cuddled with my cat this morning, she began to purr. In response, my heart began to sing. So my voice joined in. &#8220;Thank You, Jesus. Thank You, thank You Jesus.&#8221;
  
It was a song I learned at boarding school in West Africa.
  
As I sang, I remembered &#8212; that song was not written to thank God for cats. He did much greater things than that.
  
But sometimes I can&#8217;t wrap my mind around the greatness, so I simply savor the simple.
  
A quiet, peaceful moment in a busy day. A purring cat. A happy heart.
  
Thank You, Abba. Thank You so, so much.
