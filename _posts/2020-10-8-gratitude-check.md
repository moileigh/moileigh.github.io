I think it&#39;s a good day for a Thankful Thursday. It&#39;s been a while since I sat down and took an inventory of the positives within my reach. It&#39;s so much easier to just complain about everything that&#39;s going wrong. So here&#39;s my challenge: Ten positives. And they need to be real positives, not complaints in reverse. For example, I won&#39;t say that I&#39;m thankful I have a full roll of paper towels as a way to complain that my cat just threw up in the kitchen. Um, I&#39;ll be right backâ€¦

Ok. I&#39;m back.

>Number 1: I&#39;m thankful for the fall colors outside my window. The trees have turned absolutely gorgeous this year with the oranges, yellows, browns, and reds. All my favorite colors scattered over my yard.

>Number 2: I&#39;m thankful for the extra time with my daughter this week. We bought a new computer game and have spent hours online playing it and chatting about our days, hours, and minutes.

>Number 3: I&#39;m thanking for that computer game.

>Number 4: I&#39;m thankful that I have electricity and working internet (which is a little bit of a cheat, since I'm really only thankful for it today because I didn&#39;t have yesterday due to the storm, but nope, I&#39;m not complaining about that).

>Number 5: I&#39;m thankful for a fridge, cabinet, and belly full of food. I really do have all that I need, and the resources to get more.

>Number 6: I&#39;m thankful for my coworkers. People who share ideas and supplies, who watch my class so I can run to the bathroom, who make extra photocopies of great worksheets and leave them on my desk, who spend hours in my classroom after school brainstorming with me how to best meet the needs of our students.

>Number 7: I&#39;m thankful that my parents moved into the in-law apartment next door. It&#39;s been nice having them nearby, watching TV at night with my Dad, sneaking out on shopping expeditions with my Mom. After growing up in boarding school, I treasure this time together.

>Number 8: I&#39;m thankful for my health. It was scary having to leave my house and head back out into the world of work. It was frightening watching the numbers rise when the world shut down back in March. But right here, right now, all is well.

>Number 9: I&#39;m thankful that tomorrow is a virtual school day with online PD and that Monday is a holiday. That makes four days in a row that I can sit around in pjs reading books if I want to.

>Number 10: I&#39;m thankful for this blog. This opportunity to write. For the daily reminder to refocus. To stop complaining, worrying, and being afraid. To look at the Master who walks on water instead of staring at the waves.

Life really is Good. That list was surprisingly easy to write. My heart feels lighter. Right now, I really do have &quot;the wonderful love of my blessed redeemer way down in the depths of my heart,&quot; as the old song says. Right now, it&#39;s an absolutely beautiful day to be alive.

So what are you thankful for?
