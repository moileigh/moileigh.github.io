Day four
  
Am I really already on day five???

Day three was a long day of driving. I woke up in Pennsylvania, then I spread out my blanket in the sun and had a picnic lunch somewhere in Ohio. At a mid afternoon bathroom break I picked up a Starbuck&#8217;s refresher. I&#8217;ve never tried an energy drink, and I don&#8217;t drink coffee, so I was left refreshed enough to drive right through Indiana and into Illinois. I also slipped into another time zone and gained an hour of driving time. 682 miles. Not my longest, but a good day.

Day four was more relaxed. I got an earlier start and squeezed in more sightseeing. Only about 530 miles that day. I saw eight windmill turbines being driven down the highway. I popped into &#8220;American Picker&#8221;&#8216;s Antique Archeology. I saw the world&#8217;s largest truck stop &#8211; with 900 trucker spots. I saw an 11 foot Easter Island type Maui head, walked through a garden that trumps Tower Hill, took some pictures of Freedom Rock, and stood underneath a VW bug that had been transformed into a huge spider. Really. I&#8217;ll show you a picture.

The best part, though, was walking along the longest pedestrian bridge linking two states and taking a picture while standing in both. Not quite Four Corners, but on a bridge, in two states, taking a picture &#8211; as the sun was thinking about setting. This is why I road trip.

Well, that, and all of the alone time to chat with Abba. And the friends and family I greet along the way. Today I&#8217;m hoping to bump into a cousin in Boulder. Then I&#8217;ll turn my car in a more southerly direction and head on down to Houston.

Thanks for all the comments on my pics &#8211; it kind of feels like you&#8217;re along for the ride with me. ðŸ™‚
