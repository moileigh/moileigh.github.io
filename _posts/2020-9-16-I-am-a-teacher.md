**(Parody of Fight Song by Rachel Patten)**  
**Note: It helps to play the song while reading these lyrics.**

Just a small square  
on my laptop  
smiling at me  
from Zoom  
a child away from school  
still hoping to touch.  
I can only remotely reach  
but I can spread learning.

The learning games we couldn&#39;t play,  
final hugs and last high fives,  
I cleaned out desks and stood alone  
as we waved our last good-byes.

I am a teacher.  
Remote or in school.  
Paper or email.  
My phone has full charge.  
My admin cheers me on.  
Coworkers share plans.  
And most of my students have full connectivity.  
So I can still teach during social distancing.

Moving desks and a smaller class.  
No sharing tools during math.  
Plexiglass  
and wearing masks.  
Always ready to head back home  
and go back to learning with zoom.  
But I won&#39;t give up.  
No I won&#39;t give up.

Signs in yards and car parades,  
videos, virtual high fives,  
mailing cards and sharing food.  
We haven&#39;t said our last good-byes.

I am a teacher.  
Remote or in school.  
Paper or email.  
My phone has full charge.  
My admin cheers me on.  
Coworkers share plans.  
And most of my students have full connectivity.  
So I can still teach during social distancing.  
Covid won&#39;t stop me.

Just a small square  
on my laptop  
smiling at me  
from Zoom  
A child away from school  
still hoping to touch.  
I can only remotely reach  
but I can spread learning.

I am a teacher.  
Remote or in school.  
Paper or email.  
My phone has full charge.  
My admin cheers me on.  
Coworkers share plans.  
And most of my students have full connectivity.  
So I can still teach during social distancing.

I can still teach during social distancing.
