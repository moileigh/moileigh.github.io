On the road again.
  
Yes, I had to type that. :-). I&#8217;m sitting on the porch swing of kabin 4 at the Unadilla KOA. My sleeping bag is rolled, my car is packed, and I&#8217;m ready to take off for day two. As soon as I figure out which direction to turn from the driveway.
  
Day one is always the simplest &#8211; I just get into my car and drive until I can&#8217;t go any further. I got a late start yesterday so I really didn&#8217;t make it too far.

But yesterday was still a Big Day.

A friend from the C.S. Lewis society pointed me in the direction of the Booklovers&#8217; Gourmet &#8211; a beautiful little coffee and book shop in Webster. Mom and I drove out there yesterday and the owner agreed to sell my book on consignment. My little book is now on an actual store bookshelf. Stop by and get a picture of it for me (if you do, post it to In His Hands on Facebook &#8212; hey, while you&#8217;re at it, post a picture of yourself reading my book, too!).

Save the date &#8212; on Saturday, October 18th I&#8217;ll be doing a book reading/signing at the Booklovers&#8217; Gourmet. Be sure to come. I&#8217;m hoping to have my second book (All Is Well: Poems From the Detour) available by then. That&#8217;s one of my tasks for this road trip &#8211; I&#8217;m planning to retype and format two poems a night. I did meet quota last night.

So, I&#8217;m going to post this, then get on with the journey.
  
Thanks again for traveling with me.

I&#8217;d love to hear from some of you &#8212; what &#8216;detours&#8217; has God brought you along lately?
