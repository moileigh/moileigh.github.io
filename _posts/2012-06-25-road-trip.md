<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  Yesterday I began my road trip.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  I got up early, after staying up late packing, and began loading up my car with food, clothes, and other supplies. I was a bit nervous (aka, stomach-aching afraid) that I was making the wrong decision. Should I really be driving off alone across the country again? Maybe I should be staying home and getting the house clean for Mom and Dad&#8217;s return. Or working on my doctoral studies. Or&#8230; Finally I stilled, sat on the couch and asked Abba, &#8220;Is it ok that I&#8217;m going on this trip?&#8221; But then I was up and off before He&#8217;d answered. I had to get the car packed before the first service at church&#8230;
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  As I was rearranging the supplies in my car, working around the knot in my stomach, I slowly became aware of the steady stream of conversation my neighbor was keeping up with her dog. In a calm, steady, love-filled voice, she was saying, &#8220;&#8230;You&#8217;re stressing out too much. It&#8217;s no big deal. What are you stressing out for? You&#8217;re stressing out too much&#8230;&#8221;
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  And I got it. Again.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  And I relaxed.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  I made it through Connecticut (stopped at Dinosaur State Park), New York and New Jersey bumper to bumper traffic, and into Pennsylvania. Now I&#8217;m hanging out with a dear friend, her husband and daughter, and, of course, our Abba.
