**(I wrote this one for a poetry reading a couple of years before COVID)**

Caught  
in a chaotic cycle of unfinished projects,  
unexpected tasks,  
and unrealistic expectations.

Sprinting breathlessly, near broken,  
on a treadmill that only runs uphill.  

phones ringing  
dogs begging  
milk spilling  
kids screaming  
nylons running  
car skidding  
doors slamming  
checks bouncing  
blue lights flashing  
surgeons slicing  
batteries dying  
just missing  

Something needs to stop.

Set down the plate.  
Hop off the treadmill.  
Close the calendar  
and open the window.

Look out at the world beyond your box  
beyond your problems  
beyond yourself.

Look and see.

That chaotic cycle is not all there is.  
You are part of a world that is so much bigger  
than you can ever imagine.

You are part of a plan  
that is so much grander than you can even dream.

Just imagine â€“  

there are tiny pine needles  
on baby trees  
growing on mountains  
so far off the traveled path  
that no human eye will ever see them.

There are glowing fish swimming in ocean trenches  
deeper than a manmade submarine will ever travel.  

There are huge burning balls of fiery gasses  
balanced in an ever expanding expanse of space  
that quietly twinkle when we look up at night.

No, our chaotic cycle is not all there is.

We are just a tiny, but most beloved, part  
of His mighty creation.

We are small.

Time is short.

But our life will last forever.

So take your time.  
Claim each moment  
and live outside of the cycle.
