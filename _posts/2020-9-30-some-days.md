Some days my feet really hurt by the end of the day. Especially when I wear the wrong shoes. On those days, I come home, unpack my bag, feed my cats, make my supper, and collapse into my armchair with my head back and my feet up.

Some days it&#39;s my head that hurts at the end of the day. It&#39;s hard to drink enough water when I have to sanitize my hands and remove my mask every time I want to take a sip. My classroom also tends to have some louder moments, and sometimes some unique sciency smells that trigger my allergies. On those days, I usually crawl into bed early, dim the lights, and try to read.

Some days my heart hurts by the end of the day. My little ones all have long and fascinating stories. And just like the rest of us, some days their stories take sad turns. On those days, after the cats are loved and fed, I find a quiet corner and share their stories with God. He already knows their stories. But I often feel better after reminding Him about them, and sometimes He fills my heart with a little extra love for them and some wisdom on how to best help them.

Some days I drag myself home exhausted at the end of the day. Those are the days I usually collapse on the couch with my phone and spend the evening on Facebook while binge watching Netflix. Probably not the best use of my time, but finding the remote is about all that I have the physical and mental energy left to accomplish.

Some days I come home on a sugar high from birthday cupcakes. Some days I come home excited about a lesson that flowed together perfectly or a child who had an aha moment in math. Some days I come home upset about a frustrating misunderstanding or a cancelled meeting. Some days I come home elated about a canceled meeting.

But my favorite days are the days I come home and dance in the kitchen while supper is cooking, full of grateful joy that I am who I am and get to do what I do. I get paid to play games, chat about feelings and math problems, and read stories out loud. And (for the most part) I love it! It&#39;s what I was shaped to do.

God created each of us with talents, gifts, and character traits. Our life experiences shape us, giving us specific skills, insights, and empathies. Our economic status and cultural background provide a variety of opportunities and experience. Our heart pulls us in certain directions, and toward certain people. These and other factors all meld together to make each of us uniquely useful and essential. When we all work together, confident in our self and our job, we could be unstoppable!

Today, may you know and follow your heart. May you see something positive in the negatives in your life. May you remember your worth. And may you dance in grateful joy that you are who you are and get to do what you do.
