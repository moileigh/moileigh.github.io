Sometimes I worry about the future.

I wonder what things will be like when my parents aren&#39;t here anymore. When it&#39;s time to sell my house and move into something smaller. When I have to do my own yard work and find all the answers on my own. And I worry.

But then, I have to remind myself, yet again, that _that_ is not today.

Today, my parents are here. Today the yard work is done. Today is a beautiful, warm, sunny mid-November day. Today my cat is curled up in his puzzle box watching me type. Today I have a game night scheduled with my daughter because I don&#39;t have to go to work tomorrow, and I have a broccoli and cheese quiche baking in the oven.

Why spoil this wonderful moment by worrying about one that hasn&#39;t yet arrived?

Let&#39;s all agree to deal with tomorrow in the morning. We&#39;re not ignoring it. We can set aside some provisions and make some preparations. But let&#39;s not get emotionally invested in it.

Let&#39;s save that emotional energy for the people sitting next to us.

Let&#39;s focus on today, savoring the right here and the right now. Seeking out the beauty in the moment, enjoying the warmth and simple pleasures. Being truly thankful for what is currently in our hands and within our reach. Loving who we are and who we are becoming in and through this moment. Thanking the Creator for the golden sunset slipping between the treesâ€¦

My cat just crawled out of his box and joined me at the computer, purring and head butting my hands for a head rub. It&#39;s time for me to hit submit and fully enjoy this moment.
