I wrote this one just before COVID…

>It&#39;s been a while since I could do this. I&#39;m sitting in the swing I bought on some exotic vacation with Wyn – maybe in Mexico. Or perhaps in Africa. Somewhere far away and warm and peaceful.

>I spend a lot of summer days in this swing – reading books or playing on my phone. The top hooks to the beam of my balcony and swings and sways as I push my toes against the posts. Sometimes I&#39;m facing the water, the sun in my eyes. Sometimes I spin toward the wall of my house, cooling quickly in the shade, catching a glimpse of a cat in the window.

>It&#39;s peaceful but it&#39;s not quiet. The birds are loud – singing and screeching, whistling and warbling. Some cawing. If I sit still long enough they come back to the feeder and squabble at the birdbath.

>Now and then a car drives by, or a truck rattles loudly as it hits the bump by the culvert. I can hear an intermittent banging as someone&#39;s working on the other side of the wooded wetland. Occasionally an airplane passes high overhead.

>Other than the fleeting bird shadows and the swaying swing, everything is still. The woodchucks are tucked away. The beavers have moved downstream. We&#39;ve got a muskrat who comes out now and then and a pair of coons who raid the birdfeeder at night, but they&#39;re all resting right now.

>As am I.

>Resting.

>I haven&#39;t been doing much of that lately. I&#39;ve been doing. I&#39;ve been reading. I&#39;ve been writing. I&#39;ve been cleaning. Cooking. Sorting, teaching, going. I&#39;ve even been waiting. But I haven&#39;t been resting.

>Today as I carried the groceries into the house I realized just how beautiful it was out. So I stuck the food in the fridge, grabbed a book, a pad, and a pen and hung up my swing.

>As soon as I crawled into the netting and tucked up my feet, I felt it – my soul was at rest.

>Getting things done is so, so important. Spending time with loved ones is also extremely important. Taking time to relax – watching tv, reading a book, going to bed early – that&#39;s important, too.

>But resting is absolutely essential.

>I&#39;ve heard that 20 minutes in nature can help reset your brain.

>I know that 20 minutes in my swing stills my heart and slows my breathing.

>The worries about what&#39;s done and not done fade under the birdsong.

>When I&#39;m in my swing, it&#39;s so simple and easy to be still and know that He is God.

>The sun has slipped behind a cloud, reminding me that we are still in the early days of spring but I&#39;m not ready to go back inside just yet.

>I know I&#39;ll have to and I know my to do list is still in there waiting for me, unchanged and unfinished. But now it&#39;s also undaunting.

I hope that you and yours have been able to find rest for your hearts, minds, and souls during these chaotic times.
