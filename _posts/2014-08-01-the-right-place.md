It&#8217;s been a great road trip &#8211; but I&#8217;m slowing down. Today I&#8217;ll spend some time by the pool, and do a load of laundry. Have a late lunch at Denny&#8217;s, then head toward Houston. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll reconnect with a dear friend and spend a couple of days laughing and eating chocolate. Then Ry will point himself toward home and chug his fastest, dodging grasshoppers and raindrops all the way.

Did you know that it&#8217;s only 25 and a half hours from Houston to Charlton? Add in a few naps, bathroom breaks, and gas fill ups and I should be home by Thursday.

I&#8217;ve tremendously enjoyed this trip.
  
I&#8217;ve tremendously enjoyed this summer &#8211; a month ago I was riding a mototaxi in Korogo, Cote D&#8217;Ivoire! Not quite as comfy as my RAV, but many less grasshoppers.

A month from now I&#8217;ll be back in my classroom with my new crew of little ones to love and guide. Last year was a very difficult year &#8211; the kind of year that leaves you reconsidering your goals in life. This summer has been a chance to do that. A chance to realize and reaffirm that, yes, I am in the right place. At least for right now. And that&#8217;s all we really need to know, right? That we&#8217;re in the right place right now.

Enjoy your today!
