I&#8217;ve been told more than once that I often seem unapproachable. Even mean. And yes, I guess I can understand this. Just to let you know, though, I&#8217;m not mean. Just way-too-afraid of rejection. I don&#8217;t make friends quickly or easily. I push the world away in an unconscious act of self-preservation.
  
And I&#8217;ve decided to work on this.
  
So today, I practiced smiling. I&#8217;m smiling right nowÂ  as I&#8217;m typing this. See: ðŸ™‚
  
So I smiled as I joined a friend for lunch. And I smiled as I slowly savored my hot fudge sundae with cookie dough ice cream. Hey &#8212; I&#8217;m pretty good at this. This is actually easy.
  
I smiled as I did some cleaning, sorted some papers, and flipped through my text book. I smiled as I logged onto facebook and scrolled through my news feed. So far so good.
  
But then it became a bit more challenging. My smile slipped a bit when I found out the actual cost to repair a leaking strut. And it waivored when the cost of new front brakes was kindly tacked on. The burnt out brake light may have turned it into a wince for just a moment&#8230; But I smiled as I signed the work order.
  
As I searched for a comfy spot to sit, my smile must have slipped a bit because when I met the eye of the older gentleman across the room I realized I wasn&#8217;t smiling. So I smiled at him as I sank into a seat and pulled out my phone to check in with my on-line class.
  
Suddenly I hear in a whisper from behind a hand, &#8220;Thank you for that pretty smile.&#8221; Surprised, I looked up into his smiling face. I laughed, smiled again and said, &#8220;Anytime.&#8221;
  
Later, when he gathered up his bags to leave, he leaned over and said, &#8220;Have a nice day, honey.&#8221; And he walked away a friend. Suddenly the huge check I was about to write seemed so small next to the gift I had been given.
  
My heart overflowed.
  
And I smiled.
