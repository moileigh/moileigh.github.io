Abba,  
every now and then  
I feel like I&#39;m on the right path.

Am I making You happy?  
Will this path bring You glory?  
And allow You to better use me  
to advance Your kingdom?

Because that&#39;s what my life should be all about.  
You.

Am I introducing You  
to the world around me?  
Help me do a better job  
of being Your representative  
to my world.  
of sharing Your hope.  
Your peace  
and Your love.

Give me mental clarity  
and show me where to place each step.  
Give me the courage  
to keep picking up my feet  
with the blessed assurance  
that You will show me  
where to put them down.  
Just in time.  
Never early.

Thank You,  
for pen and paper,  
and for time.  
for a grandmother who prayed for me.  
for Jesus.  
for family.  
for friends.  
for today.

Thy will be done  
on earth as in Heaven.  
Whatever it is.  
Whatever it costs.
