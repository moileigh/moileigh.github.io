I just wanted to remind you that you are loved.
More than loved.
You are absolutely cherished.

Whether you know Him or not, the God Who created the world and holds it in His hands, loves you.
Whether you believe in Him or not, the Spirit who knows your best hidden secrets, loves you.

Undeniably.
Unmeasurably.
Unfailingly.

And His love is not dependent on what you do.
It doesn't change based on what you did - when no one was looking, or when a whole crowd was watching.
He simply loves you because you are you.
No matter who you are. 

No matter who you are.
No matter who you want to be. 
No matter who you wish you were.
No matter where you go.
No matter who you go with.
No matter why you go there.
No matter what you do.
No matter what you didn't do.
No matter what was done to you.
No matter... You matter!

You are loved.
More than you can ever understand.

I just wanted to remind you...
