Savor - 
Take time to taste. 

Don't waste in your haste. 

Find joy in each bite.
 
 
Hope - 
When the present seems stark,

when the night is deep dark,

cling to the light.
 

Balance - 
the beauty and pain.
 
Value tide's flow and moon's wane.
They each have a place.
 
 
Look - 
See the details in art. 

Watch the supporting actor's part. 

In the crowd, see a face.
 
Trust - 
but with wide-open eyes

to see the disguise.

And know when to fall.
 

Write -
your thoughts and your prayers,

your trysts and your tears.

Remember it all.
 
Listen - 
to the barn owl's cry

and the homeless man's sigh.

Hear what's unsaid.
 
 
Live - 
as if loved ones were dying,

and as if by your trying

you can soften their dread.
 

Pray -
Turn to the God

Who made you from clod

and let Him share your story.
 

Praise - 
from the depths and the heights,

facing pain or delight,

Live it all for His glory.
