Thank You for beauty
  
of sight,
  
of sound&#8230;
  
Images and noises that make me want to spin around
  
in joy,
  
to close my eyes
  
and sway,
  
lost in delight
  
of creation and its Creator.
  
You must love us so
  
to give us such gifts.
  
Do You smile
  
as we do
  
when we open them
  
and laugh in our delight?
  
Oh, Abba,
  
thank You!
  
Thank You
  
for Life!
