  Today&#8217;s the day I swore would never come.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
  It&#8217;s the day I drive my little one to boarding school and drop him off.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
  I can still so clearly remember the day I was dropped off. I was 12. New to Africa. New to boarding school.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
  My dad carried my old suitcase into my new room and set it down in the middle of the floor.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
  There were two dressers, two desks, two beds, and a curtain for a door. I didn&#8217;t know which bed was mine, so I sat down on my suitcase as my parents said good-bye and walked away
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
  leaving me behind&#8230;
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
  I promised to never do that to my own child.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
  But I&#8217;m going to. Today.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
  Granted, he&#8217;s very excited about the whole thing.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
  He&#8217;s 18. He chose the school &#8212; he chose to go to school. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m leaving him behind. It&#8217;s more like &#8212; like he&#8217;s leaving me behind&#8230;
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
  And for a moment I&#8217;m back sitting on that suitcase.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
  But just for a moment.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
  Because life moves on. And Life Is Good.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
  The last 18 years are Proof of that!
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
  I&#8217;m letting him go.
</div>

<span style="color: blue;">Gracefully. Gratefully. As the Abba Who will never leave me holds my heart.</span>
