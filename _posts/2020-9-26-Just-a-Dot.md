Today I accidently put a mesh bag full of masks in the dryer with my laundry.  
But I also forgot to turn the dryer on, so it all worked out.

I like those little happy moments in life when God uses my slip-ups and failings to my benefit. He uses my weaknesses to showcase His strength. Just like He uses my actions to show His love to the people I come in contact with.

When I let Him.

Because sometimes I get a bit too caught up in my current life situation to really notice what&#39;s going on around me. Like when I focus on how uncomfortable my mask is, or worry about other people standing too close to me in line. As Rick Warren so purposefully said, it&#39;s not about me. Or at least, it shouldn&#39;t be.

Although the first nine months of 2020 may have felt like an eternity, my time here on earth is just a tiny dot. Eternity is the line that I&#39;m slowly moving toward with every step, thought, and action. Eternity is where Life will begin, where I&#39;ll finally be who I was created to be â€“ without the fears and failings, without the sicknesses, aches, and pains. Eternity will start on that day when I learn from my last mistake and my last tear is wiped away by the hand of my Savior so that I can worship and love Him back with my whole healthy being.

But until then, I&#39;m here and it&#39;s now.

But it is a beautiful now. The leaves are slipping into their fall colors, the sun is shining warmly, squirrels are skipping along on the power lines, and my cat&#39;s purr can shake the house. Yes, it&#39;s a beautiful now, despite the aches and pains of 2020.

So, I&#39;ll place the fears in my God box and hang up my masks to dry. I&#39;ll turn my gaze back toward Him, dance on my dot, and love on the people who share it with me.
