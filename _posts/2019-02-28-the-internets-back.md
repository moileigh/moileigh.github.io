<p>Today, a spectrum van pulled up beside my driveway. A cheerful technician climbed out and scaled the telephone pole to attach a new cable. After almost 72 hours without an internet connection, the little blue light lit up on my black box.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how dependent we get on technology.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t blog. I couldn&rsquo;t check in to my graduate classes. I couldn&rsquo;t stream my latest Netflix show. I couldn&rsquo;t even use my printer because I don&rsquo;t have a cable to connect it to my computer. I also couldn&rsquo;t reliably send and receive phone calls because my home phone works over the internet line, which was curled up in a snowbank under a fallen tree and my cellphone has spotty service at my house.</p>
<p>But I still survived my three days without the Internet. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll go through the piled up phone messages and emails&hellip;</p>
<p>Today also makes 59 days of gluten-free, dairy-free, and sugar-free eating. It&rsquo;s been challenging, but surprisingly easier than I&rsquo;d anticipated. Unfortunately, although I&rsquo;m down nine pounds, two months on the diet hasn&rsquo;t had the hoped for results on my digestive system. While it feels a bit like quitting, we think it&rsquo;s time to try something else. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about healthy eating from this short journey. I&rsquo;ll continue to bake my own bread, have salads for lunch every day, and make my own sugar free chocolates, but I&rsquo;ll also slowly reintroduce some of the things I&rsquo;ve been avoiding. I&rsquo;ve got a few tests to line up and maybe we&rsquo;ll find a few more answers that way.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;m going to focus on the positive. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of time to read lately, and I&rsquo;ve got shelves of unread books. I had a meeting with a general surgeon this afternoon and he told me that I don&rsquo;t need surgery. I just started a new show on Netflix that I really enjoyed &ndash; and there are 14 seasons of it to enjoy! And it&rsquo;s pj day at work tomorrow.</p>
<p>Life is good.</p>
