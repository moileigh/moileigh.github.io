<div style="color: #783f04;">
  Today, for a moment, cancer won.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  It was a beautiful sunny day after a blizzard. I dawdled getting up and getting going. I slathered my gluten free waffle with creamy peanut butter and the last of the strawberry rhubarb jam. I read my Bible and scrolled through facebook.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  Then I got the text.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  The text that told me that a friend – a mentor and teacher, a coheir with Christ, a fellow cancer survivor – died this morning.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  And, for a moment, cancer won.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  Not because he died.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  But because I gave up.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  It wasn’t unexpected. His cancer had spread and his body was weak from the battle. And it wasn’t entirely unwanted – he goes to a place I long to be. He received his reward and he’s placing it at the feet of our Abba. Perhaps he’s even caught a glimpse of Grammy in the garden with Grampa.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  His last breath here brought him into a wonder that I can’t even imagine.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  But for a moment, I didn’t see any of that.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  For a moment, all I saw was CANCER.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  The pain it causes. The loved ones and body parts it steals away. The scars it leaves in its wake – seen and unseen. The way it strips away any shred of peace and hope and beats you down in fear until you’re curled in a ball sobbing.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  As I sobbed, I hated cancer with every cell in my body.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  And while I sat there sobbing, hating, broken, and despairing, cancer won.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  Praise God for the calm that comes after the storm. For the still, small voice that can speak louder than the winds howling around me. For His faithfulness, even when I lose faith.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  This world is broken. My sins helped break it.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  But God is on the move.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  I’m not sure how this blog entry is going to end. This may be one of the ones that doesn’t get wrapped up with a witty clincher sentence and a moral for a bow.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  Sometimes we don’t figure out the lesson. My son texted this morning that there’s a purpose, but “it’s not for us to know.”
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  It’s not for us to know. Job got that text, too.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  Some answers we may never find…
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  My heart is at peace now. The tears are dry. The fear is replaced by Hope. The hatred squelched down to a desire to change the world and make a difference.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  And I’m reassured.
</div>

<div style="color: #783f04;">
  Cancer may have won a minor skirmish today, but not the battle. My Abba has already won the war.
