<p>One of the goals I&rsquo;m working on is to read all of the books in my house. Which is compounded by the fact that the number of books in my house keeps growing. For my birthday last week, I went out to eat at Traveler&rsquo;s Restaurant and came home with five new (to me) books. Then yesterday morning, while I was reading, I came across three more books I want to read and ordered them online. Yesterday afternoon, I found a stack of books in a thrift store by some of my favorite authors. Yes, those came home with me, too&hellip;</p>
<p>While I am dedicating a significant amount of time toward meeting that goal, I&rsquo;ve got a suspicion that I never will.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to hit a moving target.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working on my goal of eating healthy, too, though I&rsquo;ve relaxed the rules a little bit. This afternoon, I made my broccoli egg muffins and salads for the week, then baked a loaf of bread and made a batch of raspberry jam. For supper, I had gluten free pasta with sugar free tomato sauce and ground turkey &ndash; but I&rsquo;m planning to have a slice of cheesecake for dessert.</p>
<p>That target has moved, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This past week, I went off my allergy medicine for five days to have allergy testing. They tested for both food and environmental allergies &ndash; and found nothing! After twenty-five years of taking a daily allergy pill, we&rsquo;ve discovered that I don&rsquo;t actually have allergies. I&rsquo;m not allergic to cats like my primary care insisted twenty-five years ago. And I&rsquo;m not allergic to pollen, or dust, or mold, or old books&hellip;</p>
<p>Of course, now we need to find out why I have all of the allergy systems. That target moved, too.</p>
<p>But one target hasn&rsquo;t moved. One goal hasn&rsquo;t changed.</p>
<p>I want to spend more time visiting with my Creator and I want that time to change me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to take the time to watch the sun set and to enjoy His creation. I want to be wiser &ndash; but not worldly wise. I want to focus more on the good and the beautiful in my world around me. I want to be kinder today than I was yesterday, but not nearly as kind as I hope to be tomorrow.</p>
<p>I want to learn to love like Christ loves.</p>
<p>I want to be the one who offers to go last. I want to be able to give away the last chocolate cupcake without wishing I could stuff it into my mouth. I want to grow to love people as much as I love completing a task.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m going to keep working toward meeting my goals.</p>
<p>And I'm going to keep working toward meeting with my Savior.</p>
<p>And I'm hoping to fall in love with my world all over again.</p>
