<p>Today was one of those days.</p>
<p>I got a flat tire on the way in to work this morning. I had made it more than three fourths of the way there before a tire slipped off the edge of the road with a bang. I drove a little further, but soon the horrid, grinding, screeching sound convinced me that I really shouldn&rsquo;t try to go the rest of the way. I pulled over, texted my boss, and called AAA. Fortunately, they had someone available and I was back on the road after about 45 minutes. Unfortunately, the wait in the drizzle while he swapped the tire for my spare left me chilled. I slipped into the classroom chilled and discombobulated, to a chorus of excited voices, and felt like I was playing catch-up for the rest of the morning.</p>
<p>It was a tough day at work, with a couple of my little ones screaming out for attention in the only ways they know (which pretty much involves screaming, standing on furniture, and lots of shredded paper).</p>
<p>Then after work, I headed out to my car and discovered that my favorite umbrella had been in the back seat and was broken when the seats were folded down. As I mourned my pink umbrella, I drove to an appointment with my ENT doctor to discuss next steps.</p>
<p>They were running late and I was running early, so it was a 45-minute wait before I was ushered into an exam room for a twenty-minute wait. Then I discovered that I had been given an appointment with the PA instead of with the doctor. He started by telling me that &ldquo;many people with post nasal drip symptoms have trouble with something called reflux-&ldquo; I stopped him there and said that I&rsquo;d already discussed that with the doctor and he didn&rsquo;t feel it was the case. The PA then looked at the computer and stated that there was a note there saying that it probably wasn&rsquo;t the cause in my case. We continued on with a rather unproductive conversation for about fifteen minutes before we mutually decided that it might be better if I scheduled an appointment to see the doctor again. I made an appointment for next week and headed home.</p>
<p>Exhausted. Discouraged. Fighting tears.</p>
<p>Because it was one of those days.</p>
<p>One of those days when everything seems to go wrong. One of those days when the little things pile up so high it all just becomes too big.</p>
<p>One of those days.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s only half the story&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s only the story when I&rsquo;m focused on me. There are so many other characters to focus on.</p>
<p>The tow truck drive was cheerful and friendly as he came over to my car telling me it was going to be a long day. I was his third flat tire of the morning.</p>
<p>Then my parents came out and picked up my car to bring it to Midas and replace the tire while I was working. My school secretary was a great go-between, passing messages and holding my keys.</p>
<p>My coworkers were very supportive. A friend next door covered my class while I was running late, then came in and spent some one-on-one time with one of my little ones while I focused on teaching the math lesson. Then another started a conversation about what new supports we can implement to help my struggling students.</p>
<p>And my students were so cheerful and excited when I walked into the classroom. They were kind to each other, and helped each other and me. I was rubbing my hands together because they still felt cold and one little girl came over to me. &ldquo;Let me help,&rdquo; she said as she wrapped her hands around mine.</p>
<p>After supper, my best friend stopped by and we cried together and laughed together about our tough days.</p>
<p>Now, as I'm thinking back over my day, my perspective has changed. It was still a draining day. I&rsquo;m still exhausted. But now I&rsquo;m smiling. My mantra has changed.</p>
<p>Some days my life is full to the brim with love.</p>
<p>Today was one of those days.</p>
