You held my heart through radiation.
  
You filled me with peace while my son slept on the streets.
  
You placed a song in my heart the day my grandfather died.
  
You taught me contentment when I was bald and breastless.

I ran from you again and again,
  
yet You were never more than a step behind me with Your arms open wide.

So I can dance with joy
  
in the uncertainty of the unknown.
