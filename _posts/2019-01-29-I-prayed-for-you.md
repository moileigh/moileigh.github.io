<p><span style="color: #993366;">I prayed for you today.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">Yes, you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">I prayed that God would fill your life with purpose and guide your steps as you meander forward. That He would grant you wisdom as you make the minute decisions of life that build up into life choices and determine where and how you end each day.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">I prayed that He&rsquo;d remind your heart of how fragile, and how cherished, you are. You are loved by the creator of rainbows, icebergs, poodles, and constellations. You are cherished by the God who started time ticking. The God who formed your heart, and knows you better than you know yourself, is utterly devoted to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">Even when you turn your back on Him. Even when you fail. Even when you slip, when you meant well but missed the mark by a hair, when you weren&rsquo;t even close. Because, none of that really matters. Nothing you do really matters. All that matters is what He&rsquo;s already done.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">He created you. He cared for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">He wrote you love notes in vivid colors across the sky as he made the sun rise and set. He let you make your own choices. He used the results of those choices to shape you and make you a stronger, wiser, <em>more you</em> you. And He stands beside, behind, and before you with open arms, ready to catch you the second you turn to Him.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">May your heart taste, even if only for a moment, how much you are loved.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">He made the mother&rsquo;s heart. And His love for you is so much greater than that of a mother for her child.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">I pray that you remember that during the dark, lonely days of winter. When the storms swirl and howl around you. When you find yourself lost and alone, and lonely. When your heart is broken beyond repair and life just hurts too much.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">Remember.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">Abba loves you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">He knows your pains. He knows your private wants and wishes, your if-onlys.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">He knows what you&rsquo;ll need even before you do. And He loves you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">I just wanted you to know that I prayed for you today.</span></p>
