 Sometimes  
 you just need to hit the pause button.

Hit pause,  
gently put down the remote,  
and walk away.

It&#39;s not a full stop.  
It&#39;s not a vacation  
or an escape  
or an avoidance.  
It&#39;s just a pause.

A chance to smell a flower,  
turn a page,  
run to the bathroom,  
or sit and stare out the window.

A chance to shut the computer and rest your eyes,  
take a mask break,  
take a deep breath and let it out slowly.

A pause to text a friend,  
find a plug,  
take a sip,  
or take off your shoes.

A chance to rethink before you speak,  
to change your mind,  
or perhaps to apologize.

An appropriately placed pause  
can prevent the need  
for an apology.

A well-timed pause  
can save a lot of time.

A well-used pause  
can leave you with peace,  
confidence,  
hope,  
and a renewed positivity  
and energy  
as you reach out  
to pick up the remote  
and push play.
