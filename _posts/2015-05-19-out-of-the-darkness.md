I wear a bracelet that says &#8220;out of the darkness.&#8221;

It&#8217;s a reminder.
  
A reminder of a pain I hope I never have to bear.
  
A friend of mine lost her middle son to suicide.
  
He was lost in a darkness he thought he couldn&#8217;t bear.

And as I pondered this pain of losing a cherished son
  
And fought with God over my own
  
I finally came to the place where I let go.

Abba &#8211; Your will be done.
  
Whatever may come.
  
Would I take that pain so my dear friend didn&#8217;t have to?
  
Father, Your will be done.
  
Whatever may come.

Then came that oh-so-obvious realization.
  
My Abba felt that pain.
  
My Abba lost His cherished only son to the darkness.
  
But only for a moment,
  
A horrible three day long moment.
  
Then He rose from the dead
  
To lead us all
  
Out of the darkness.
