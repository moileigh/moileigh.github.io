I love browsing the Crazy Deals at Ocean State Job Lots. They usually involve making specific purchases and getting rewarded with store gift cards, and they often involve items that I would normally have absolutely no interest in purchasing. Or later wish I hadn't.

There was a Crazy Deal on toilet paper a couple of weeks back. I was so excited that we received the flyer describing it on the same day I stole the last roll of tp from my guest bathroom that I didn&#39;t bother to read the fine print. It wasn&#39;t until the third time I used it that I discovered that the new, odd perfumy scent in my bathroom was actually wafting up from my roll of toilet paper. It was scented! Yeah, I kind of regret making that deal.

Sometimes crazy deals are just, well, crazy. For a while they had another one: spend $1500 on thermometers and get a $1000 crazy deal card. Everyone&#39;s birthday and Christmas presents would be from Job Lots for decades to come! I wonder how many thermometers that would get me…

As I sat deeply pondering the various crazy deals I&#39;ve participated in (it was another long day of training), I realized that Jesus made the ultimate crazy deal.

I can almost picture Jesus trying to explain it.

>I&#39;m going to slip out of this temple here in Heaven and go live in poverty as little kid. I&#39;ll grow up slowly, dealing with all the typical teenage stuff. Then I&#39;m going to turn the world upside down, before being arrested, tortured, and executed for it. In exchange I&#39;ll get… You.

>No, not in a &#39;you&#39;re my slave, you must serve me and do my every command&#39; kind of way. But in a &#39;you get to move into my temple and be part of my family&#39; kind of way.

>No, you don&#39;t have to do anything. I&#39;ll take care of it.

>So what do you think? Do we have a deal?

God Himself took human form, lived, died and rose again so that I could later join Him in Heaven and Live.

It&#39;s crazy.

But it&#39;s one deal I&#39;m snatching up with no regrets!
