  It&#8217;s not about having to say no to temptation over and over again.
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  It&#8217;s just about keeping your eyes on the cross.
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  So I’ve been thinking… Yes, you do a lot of that on a road trip. And the places my mind takes me are just as varied as the places my car’s been going lately. This particular thought process focused on temptation.
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  Why is it that we can be super good at resisting temptation, saying no 9,999 times, but that the one time we say yes the whole house of cards comes tumbling down? No matter how many times I say no, that one yes is going to knock me all the way back down to the bottom rung of the ladder. It’s hopeless. So what’s the point?
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  Now I know that Christ died for me, and that His shed blood has washed me clean as new-fallen snow, and that my sins – past, present, and future &#8212; are as far from me as the East is from the West. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>But I also know that Christ turned to the unstoned woman and told her, “Go now, and sin no more.” I’m supposed to be perfect. I’m supposed to be sin-free. I’m supposed to say no all 10,000 times.
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  But I can’t.
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  And then my music station gets staticky as I’m driving along the road. I switch to a new station, and suddenly God’s shouting at me through the voice on the radio. “Sin is still in me! Without Him I can do nothing! I need a Savior on a daily, ongoing basis!”
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  And I hear, and begin to understand.
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  I finally accepted my failures. I faced my inabilities. I renewed my commitment as I drove through Baton Rouge.
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  Abba –
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  I cave every time.
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  Always have. Always will.
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  I’m human. I’m weak.
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  In my moment of temptation,
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  I will turn to the cross.
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  I won’t even try to resist.
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  I’ll simply cave into Your arms.
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  And let You resist.
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  I am insufficient.
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  You are almighty.
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
</div>

<div style="color: blue; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
  That’s the point – isn’t it? To end up in His arms…
</div>
