I ripped the strap on one of the dresses that I brought for my trip. Hopefully I can pick up a cheap sewing kit along the way. I didn&#8217;t bring one because, well, I don&#8217;t sew.

Yesterday I explored a bit of Pennsylvania. I even stopped to see a house built in the shape of a shoe &#8212; &#8216;the only one like it in the world&#8217;! At four o&#8217;clock, I began looking at my aps to find a stopping place for the night. I called three KOAs, all in the right direction and within a three hour drive, but none had available kabins.

I looked at the clock &#8211; it was 4:30. &#8216;OK, God. I&#8217;m putting this one in your hands. I&#8217;d like to eat at five, then we&#8217;ll figure out lodging.&#8217; So I pulled back out onto the highway and headed west.

At about 4:55, I passed a billboard advertising Denny&#8217;s at a Flying J Truck stop and my heart grinned. That had been my favorite restaurant on my very first solo road trip. I must have eaten there at least four days in a row. I plugged it into my gps and took the next exit. It wasn&#8217;t right off the highway, so I had a couple of turns to make, and along the way I passed an Econo Lodge. Hmmmm&#8230;. Tonight&#8217;s stopping place?

I ate dinner (bourbon chicken with broccoli and a side of Mac and cheese, I ordered grapefruit juice but she brought me cranberry), then returned to the Econo Lodge.
  
&#8216;How much for a room?&#8217;
  
&#8216;Well, we&#8217;ve got a promotion going on&#8230;&#8217;

For only ten dollars more than my kamping kabin, I got ac, cable, my own bathroom, and a complimentary breakfast. But wait, there&#8217;s more. The best part was when the manager handed me a complementary sewing kit.

Well played, Abba. I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m on Your team.
