It&#39;s Friday!  
You made it!  
Finally!  
You worked hard.  
Well done!  
Pat yourself on the back.  
Now it&#39;s time to play hard  
Or to rest intentionally  
To listen to what your body is crying out at you  
and go for a walk  
or sit with a cat  
or read a book in a hot bath.  
Maybe you need to pick up the phone and call a dear friend  
or maybe you need to turn your phone off and sit on the front porch  
listening to the neighbors  
the birds  
the silence.  
You may unwind by venting to a spouse  
or writing in a journal  
or blogging an inspirational message to share on the internet.  
Do _you_!  
Because that&#39;s who you do best.  
The work week is over.  
Drop the demands that others have placed on you  
and find out what your own heart is demanding.  
Sit still  
and listen to your heart beat  
or go for a run  
and change your heart beat.  
Eat the ice cream _and_ the cake  
or just enjoy the salad.  
Enjoy the sun.  
Enjoy the sounds.  
Enjoy the time.  
Enjoy being you.
