To the person who&#39;s still waiting,

Hang in there.

Whether you&#39;re waiting for a phone call, an answer, an end, a sign, or a significant other – you&#39;ve got this. You will get through this moment, and there are better ones ahead.

This wait is simply a part of your journey. Claim it. Don&#39;t let the torment of waiting steal your precious seconds and minutes. Or hours and days. Or even years…

Some of us have been waiting for a long time. We long-term waiters have to learn how to enjoy the wait instead of barely surviving it.

Sometimes distraction helps. Go on a new adventure, take a dance class, phone a friend. Put a leash and harness on the cat and take it outside. Sometimes, just switching your focus makes the wait time go by more quickly.

But maybe it&#39;s too big right now. Maybe you need to lean into it. It&#39;s ok to cry, to scream into the pillow, to find something to punch or curl up into a ball and rock for a while.

But not forever.

Take a moment to feel the feelings. Then go find someone to sit with. To talk it over with. To touch.

Or try writing about it. My fears and worries often seem to shrink as I pour them into written words.

I wish I could hold yours for you. I can&#39;t.

But I know Someone Who can.

Our Savior had to wait, too.

Jesus knew the aches and pains of life, and the torment of waiting. That night, as He knelt, prayed, and wept in the garden, waiting for His friend to betray Him. Waiting for the torture and crucifixion He knew was coming. He didn&#39;t want to do it. He begged God, &quot;Is there any other way?&quot; But He stayed. And He waited. Because of how much He loves you.

He understands the overwhelming, almost unendurable emotions of waiting. And He is waiting with you.

Cling to that. Cling to Him. And hang in there.

With love,

A fellow waiter
