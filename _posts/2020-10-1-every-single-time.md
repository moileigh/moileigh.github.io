I don&#39;t stop and listen  
Nearly as often as I should.  
I don&#39;t hunt You down  
Or wait patiently  
When I can&#39;t hear Your voice in the storm  
Or the silence.  
I don&#39;t shout your message loudly  
To the busy crowd  
Rushing to work in the morning.  
I don&#39;t remember  
To thank You  
For every good gift You place  
In my hands.  
I don&#39;t live as I ought.  
I don&#39;t trust You to solve the little problems in my life  
Without complaining first.  
I don&#39;t give my last dollar –  
I might need it tomorrow.  
I don&#39;t turn the other cheek,  
And I don&#39;t always forgive…

But You always listen.  
You always hunt me down  
And hold me tightly.  
You are patient in the storm of my life.  
You shout Your message to me  
As I walk beside the busy crowd  
Rushing to work in the morning.  
You keep placing good gifts in my hands.  
You solve the big problems and  
Shape me through the little problems.  
You put up with my complaints.  
You meet my every need.  
You turned the other cheek,  
Over, and over, and over again.  
Through the death of Your son,  
You forgive me  
every single time.
