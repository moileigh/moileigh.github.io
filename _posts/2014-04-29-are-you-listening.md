<div>
  I didn’t get good news when I called the mechanic about my car yesterday morning. He swapped the sensor on the new (used) transmission, but the speedometer was still wobbly. He would need to open up the dashboard and look inside to find the problem, and it could be very expensive. I asked if it would be less than $500, and he simply repeated that it could be very expensive.
</div>

<div>
  Finally I told him to take it apart and look at it. If it was too expensive, I’d just have him put it back together and ignore the bobbling orange needle.
</div>

<div>
  Then I prayed.
</div>

<div>
  But I couldn’t hear God’s answer. I asked for a number – then I’d know if I should have it repaired or not. If the cost of repairs was higher than that number, I’d know to say no. But no number was given. I asked for a yes/no – should I repair it? Should I begin car shopping? But no answer. I began to get frustrated. Finally I asked Him if He was even listening. But my heart knew that He was. So I kept asking, and then simply placed it in His hands. Because I know He’s got this, too. Somehow.

<div>
  I went to work, driving the smart one – so thankful that mom had bought it before she left. I waited, checking my phone whenever I had a break throughout the day. Around 1:45, in the middle of my prep period, the mechanic called.
</div>

<div>
  He’d opened up the dash and tried a couple of things, but nothing fixed the problem. Then, he decided to check inside the new (used) transmission, and found a loose gear. He said this is a very rare problem and he’d never seen it in a Toyota before. He’s already ordered a new (used) transmission. Unfortunately it’ll be another week, but it won’t cost me anything.
</div>

<div>
  Which is why God didn’t give me a number. He knew I really didn’t need one. He wasn’t ignoring me at all. He just wanted me to wait and see. To trust Him. To let Him be God of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">all</i>the details…
</div>

<div>
  Is there anything <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">you</i>need to leave in God’s hands today?
