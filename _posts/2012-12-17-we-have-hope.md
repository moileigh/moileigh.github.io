  Halfway through my plate of gluten free crackers and apple slices, I got the call – 2 hour delay. We have a new superintendent and the call came later than usual. I’m already up, showered, dressed – too late to go back to bed, and too slippery to head in to school just yet.
</div>

<div>
  So I guess now is as good a time as any to sit down with a nub of pencil and a scrap of paper.
</div>

<div>
  Yesterday was Grammy’s memorial service. And it was beautiful.
</div>

<div>
  So many great stories of who she was and what she did.
</div>

<div>
  So much laughter. So much Hope.
</div>

<div>
  And a little bit of letting go.
</div>

<div>
  Today –
</div>

<div>
  Well, today’s a new start.
</div>

<div>
  With a smile in my eyes, and a deep joy in my heart, I’m stepping forward…

  When I ripped this paper out of my notebook, I found another, folded page tucked in underneath it. It was a letter that I’d written to a friend, but apparently never sent. I thought I’d share part of it with you.
</div>

<div>
  “I just wanted you to know that I prayed for you today. I sat down with Abba and told Him about your excitement for His creation, for His loved ones. And I thank Him for creating you…. And then I told Him you weren’t feeling well. Though, of course, He already knows that. He knows every detail of your life – your deepest thoughts, your strongest fears, what makes you smile, what you dream about at night.
</div>

<div>
  And He loves you – so much more than your mind or heart will ever be able to understand.
</div>

<div>
  Cling to that. Cling to Him. He’s the only thing that lasts. Pain will fade. Sorrow will be banished. Life will be good again. Cling to that.”
</div>

<div>
  In this broken, upside-down, heart wrenching world, we do have Hope.
</div>

<div>
  Cling to Him.
