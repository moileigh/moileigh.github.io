Today I heard a voice whisper  
&quot;You can&#39;t do this.  
You are not enough.&quot;

I looked around at the chaos around me  
unfinished tasks,  
half-written plans,  
unanswered questions  
and I had to whisper back  
&quot;You&#39;re right. I&#39;m not.&quot;

But then I raised my head  
I straightened my spine  
and I lifted my voice.  
&quot;But I am not alone.&quot;

&quot;I have coworkers  
who walk beside me  
and share the burden.

&quot;I have family  
who walk behind me  
making sure I don&#39;t fall behind  
and before me  
to show me a way.

&quot;I have a God  
Who works within me  
to strengthen,  
equip,  
prepare and protect,  
and cherish me  
come whatever may  
whenever it may come.

&quot;I am not enough,  
but I was never asked to be.&quot;

I returned to my work  
resting in the promise  
that together, WE are enough.
