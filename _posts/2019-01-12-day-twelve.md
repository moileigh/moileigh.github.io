And just like that, we're at Day Twelve, the day most Americans give up on their resolutions.
I almost didn't blog.
But I figured that today was not the best day to skip.
Because that's how it happens, isn't it?
You are doing something faithfully, every day, so you decide it won't hurt to take just one day off.
But that one day throws off the routine and dwindles the momentum.
Somehow you never even notice when you slip off the track.
You see something six months later that reminds you of that track that you used to be on when you were more resolved.
And you wonder why you stopped...

I've made a couple of resolutions this year.
I'm writing more.
I'm reading more.
I'm eating healthier.
That one is the most life-changing.
For January, I'll stick with the dairy, gluten, and sugar free plan.
Then at the end of the month, I'll reassess my symptoms and decide the plan for February.

It's actually been fun exploring recipes and trying new ingredients.
Today I made banana/blueberry/oatmeal cookies.
And I found a recipe for 'mac and cheese' that I can't wait to try.

But what I like most about the new lifestyle it's forced me to adopt is the intentionality.
I'm carefully thinking through each meal and snack.
I'm planning ahead for the times I won't be at home.
I'm setting aside large chunks of time to spend in the kitchen - and spending a lot less time mindlessly watching tv or playing on my phone.
While I can still be spontaneous and impulsive, life has fallen into a comfortable routine.
I'm feeling more productive.
This has spilled over into other areas of my life, too.

In the process of reorganizing my time to accomodate my new kitchen activities, I set aside time for other important activites as well -- like reading my Bible and chatting with Abba.
I cut out a lot of my tv time, but added in more book time.
Now I actually look forward to my alarm clock going off in the morning, because I get to read in bed for half an hour before I hop onto my treadmill.

By intentionally filling my days with beneficial and enjoyable things, I'm building a lifestyle that I can (and want to!) maintain.
Which is why I'm not going to be quitting on my New Year's Resolutions today.

I'm eager to see what the next twelve days will bring.
