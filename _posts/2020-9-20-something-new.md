I tried something new today.

Foodwise. Yeah, I don&#39;t really do that all that often. I tend to get stuck in a rut and eat the same things over and over again. I get comfortable.

It&#39;s not that I&#39;m a really picky eater. It&#39;s just that when I don&#39;t like something, I really don&#39;t like it and I strongly regret putting it in my mouth. Why take the risk when there are so many really good foods out there – like meatloaf, chicken, mashed potatoes, or broccoli?

But then again, sometimes, I discover something amazing.

A year ago, my daughter introduced me to a new recipe: Green coconut curry. It&#39;s absolutely amazing. Delicious. And really hard to mess up. You just dump a couple of cans of coconut milk into a sauce pan and stir in a spoon or two of green curry paste. Well, you&#39;re actually supposed to sauté some veggies in the pan first, but I just dump some frozen ones in later. Then you spoon it over rice and enjoy.

Over the year, I&#39;ve tried it with different vegetables. My favorite combination is Brussels sprouts and chicken, though it&#39;s not so bad with corn and broccoli. I&#39;ve never made a batch I didn&#39;t like. Until today.

Though, to be fair, it wasn&#39;t the coconut curry that I didn&#39;t like.

The last time I went to Ocean State, they had this crazy deal where if I spent at least $10 on a small selection of food, I&#39;d get an equal amount back on a crazy deal card. They had granola bars and chocolate toffee bars. I should have just stocked up on those. But they also had a ton of packages of Konjac Rice. Yes, that should have been my first clue. If Ocean State has a ton of packages of something, it might not be something I want to try. But, it was basically free.

It comes packaged in water. You just drain it, dump it in a pan of hot water for a minute, then drain it again. That&#39;s even easier than boil-in-a-bag rice. So I grabbed two packages and waited for a chance to try them.

Today was that chance. I made the sauce (today I added Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and chicken), then heated up the &#39;rice&#39;. I filled my bowl and sat down at the table to try it.

I&#39;m trying to think how best to describe it. Little, clear, gelatinous, tasteless, gummy grains? Yeah, not my favorite. It&#39;s definitely a texture thing. Not as bad as couscous, but not something I&#39;ll willingly eat. I ended up digging for treasure and eating all the veggies and chicken chunks. I was a bit disappointed, though honestly not too surprised. It does seem that the majority of new foods I try fall into the &#39;let&#39;s not try them again&#39; category. Which only makes the ones I like that much more special.

It&#39;s back to the boil-in-a-bag rice for me. Maybe I&#39;ll mix it up and get the brown.
