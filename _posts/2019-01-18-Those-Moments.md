Thank You, Abba, for the moments when I get it.

Those moments when both the aches

and the joys

of life fall away

and I’m left in Your arms

tasting just the tiniest taste of Heaven

of Reality

of Life.


Thank You, Abba, for the moments

when I remember why I was created

why I was gifted

why I was prepared and equipped

and enabled

to walk in this weary world.


Thank You, Abba, for the moments when I dance

in my mind,

in my heart,

in my body.


When the responsibilities are lifted,

when the worries are banished,

the wants fade away

and You are more real

than I have ever been.


You are Good.

You are Glorious.

You are God.


And the moment fades…

And I remember that I am me.

Stuck in the ruts of my little life

trudging forward one step at a time.


But I remember where I’m going now

and there’s a Joy in the journey.
