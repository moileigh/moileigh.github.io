<p>Tomorrow is Friday.</p>
<p>Normally that&rsquo;s an excitingly beautiful statement that always brings grins and lights up eyes. But this is vacation week. Being almost Friday means that vacation is almost over. Then it&rsquo;s just a regular weekend, and then it&rsquo;s time to go back to work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard people say that we should be living the kind of lives that we don&rsquo;t need vacations from. I think that sounds good, and for the most part, I&rsquo;d say that I do. But no matter how much we love our jobs, we all need to take a break now and then.</p>
<p>I love teaching. It&rsquo;s what I was created to do. It&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;m good at and I truly enjoy. However, it is exhausting.</p>
<p>Some of today&rsquo;s little ones bring so much baggage into that classroom. I once had a student who came in with a bruise on his forehead from where his father had hit him with a frying pan. &ldquo;I hope it was an accident,&rdquo; I told him gently. &ldquo;It was,&rdquo; he assured me. &ldquo;He was aiming for my sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How can I teach children to read when they need to be learning that they are loved? How can I grade children on how quickly they can add and subtract one and two digit numbers, when they aren&rsquo;t even able to sit in a chair for ten minutes?</p>
<p>How can I assess students on whether or not they can identify the verbs in a sentence when they&rsquo;re thinking about their empty lunchbox and wondering if they&rsquo;ll have supper tonight? When they can&rsquo;t stop their mind from wandering toward any noises passing by in the hallway? When they couldn&rsquo;t sleep last night because of growing pains? When they&rsquo;re so anxious and afraid of life that they explode when they make a mistake?</p>
<p>So I try to do it all. I bring in snacks to share while we look at nouns and verbs. I give each child a high-five as I greet them by name to remind them of how important they are to me. Then I sit on the floor and read with them. I let them stand, sit, or squat if they want while taking their timed tests, then I sort them into flexible groups to reteach and practice missing skills. I show them how to fold their paper in half to trick their brain into not panicking at the amount of work on the page. I give them headphones and &lsquo;offices&rsquo; to minimize distractions. I let them nap in the beanbag chair when they need a brief escape. Despite the old adage about teaching, I smile all year long.</p>
<p>Then, every couple of months, a vacation comes along and I rest. I let my Abba refill my emotional tanks so that when I return to that classroom His love spills out of me into them. I read new books so that I have different stories and strategies to share when we gather on the rug. I clean my house and finish up the projects that there&rsquo;s just no energy for on a school day. I recharge.</p>
<p>This vacation is going quickly. But that&rsquo;s ok, because I&rsquo;m just about ready to go back. Enjoy your Friday!</p>
