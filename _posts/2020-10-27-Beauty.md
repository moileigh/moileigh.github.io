Thank You for beauty.  
Of sight.  
Of sound.  
Of images and noises  
that make me want to spin around  
in joy.  
To close my eyes  
and sway,  
lost in delight  
of creation  
and it&#39;s Creator.

You must love us so  
to give us such gifts.  
Do You smile  
as we do  
when we open them  
and laugh in delight?  

Rainbows in the mist.  
Crickets after dark.  
Lush green and golden browns.  
Rain tapping on tin.

Are You sad  
when we rush past  
without even noticing?

Flowers pushing up  
through cracks in pavement.  
Painted sands,  
drifting leaves.  
Soft cooing in the bushes.

Life is beautiful!

When we look.  
When we listen.  
When we lift our eyes above the traffic,  
the masks,  
and the unchecked lists.  
When we try to see You  
in the hearts and the hurdles  
and the hopes  
around us.

Because You are there.  
You are always here.  
Making life beautiful.
