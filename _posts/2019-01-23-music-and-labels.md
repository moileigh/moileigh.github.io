<p><span style="color: #800000;">Driving in to work today, the radio dj asked a question: Does a lack of a Christian label on a song make it less godly?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">Unfortunately, I drove out of range of the station and had to turn off the static so I never did hear the answer. But I pondered it while I drove. And my answer is No.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">In highschool, my senior thesis was on rock music and its value within the church. In case you don&rsquo;t know, I spent my senior year as a day student at an American Christian boarding school in West Africa that had a very strict music policy. I had been written up twice for having &lsquo;illegal&rsquo; cassette tapes at the school. To be fair, the rule was ten cassettes and I did smuggle in a bag with over fifty. Twice.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">One of my tapes that was banned was a Steve Vai cassette which probably had a total of about twenty words on the whole tape. As I wrote my paper, I used my research to attempt to convince my teachers that you can&rsquo;t just ban a whole genre of music. You have to look at each song and make individual decisions. But that takes time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">Today, as I reflected on the question, I focused on the word &lsquo;label.&rsquo;</span><span style="color: #800000;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">In the education field, the controversy of using labels comes up a lot. But I don&rsquo;t see labels as defining children. I see them as defining the range of treatments that might benefit children. By assigning a child a label, I now know which particular researched-based bag of tricks will have the greatest chance of helping that child. Nothing in education is ever one-size-fits-all, but at least the label can help me narrow down what might and what won&rsquo;t help.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">I think labels in music will work similarly. Some songs defy labels. Others can wear multiple labels. The label won&rsquo;t tell me if I&rsquo;ll like a song or not. But they can certainly help me decide which song I feel like listening to in the moment. And putting the label &lsquo;Christian&rsquo; on a song doesn&rsquo;t make it any godlier than a song without that label. Just like with my students, it&rsquo;s the content that matters. Not the label.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">God can use any song to speak to your heart. He&rsquo;s used many to speak to mine. He doesn&rsquo;t need a Christian label on His tools. He&rsquo;s used (I&rsquo;ll use the less traditional word here) donkeys before. He can use anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">What are your thoughts on the question?</span></p>
