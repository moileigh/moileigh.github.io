<div style="color: blue;">
  Every now and then, cancer wins.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
</div>

 <span style="color: blue;"></span>

<div style="color: blue;">
  It’s usually around a milestone, or when I’m enduring a long wait for biopsy results. Something will get the thoughts going again, and without even realizing it I begin putting plans on hold and hurrying home each day to curl up in my comfort zone.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
</div>

 <span style="color: blue;"></span>

<div style="color: blue;">
  I’m still cheerful. I’m still hopeful. But I become very cautious and careful.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
  I stop stepping out and living courageously.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
  And cancer wins.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
</div>

 <span style="color: blue;"></span>

<div style="color: blue;">
  But then, suddenly, something will happen that proves to my frightened heart that I am still ALIVE and the calculations and statistics get stuffed back into the medical binder. The symptoms fade back into insignificance, and CANCER slips silently back into the past.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">

<div style="color: blue;">
  I remember chatting once with another cancer survivor about our hesitance to make long term plans.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
  At the time I was thinking about getting a pet, but I hadn’t been able to talk myself into doing it. There were so many &#8216;What if”s and &#8216;We don’t know what tomorrow will bring&#8217;s.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
</div>

 <span style="color: blue;"></span>

<div style="color: blue;">
  Now, as I sit watching my fifteen pound Stella perched on the back of a rocking chair gazing fixidly up at the tiny moth on the chandelier, I’m so laughingly grateful that I did it.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
</div>

 <span style="color: blue;"></span>

<div style="color: blue;">
  We can’t stop making plans because we’re afraid of what tomorrow might bring. We need to make plans in spite of what tomorrow might bring. Because of it. Sure – the plans may fall through, or need some major last minute tweaking. But they might just be magnificent.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
</div>

 <span style="color: blue;"></span>

<div style="color: blue;">
  Only God knows what tomorrow will bring. Or the 300<sup>th</sup>year after tomorrow. Or 3-5 years from May 18<sup>th</sup>… Let’s not live like we’re dying anymore.
</div>

<div style="color: blue;">
</div>

 <span style="color: blue;"></span>

<div style="color: blue;">
  Let’s live like we’re still alive!
</div>
