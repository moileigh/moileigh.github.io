Sometimes the tragedies in our lives are a direct result of something we did. Sometimes it is our fault. But often, there doesn’t seem to be a reason.

In Jesus’ time, people just assumed that bad things were sin related.

As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man who had been blind from birth. “Teacher,” his disciples asked him, “why was this man born blind? Was it a result of his own sins or those of his parents?” (John 9:1-2)

Their question wasn’t why was the man blind, but whose sin caused it. Jesus gave them a different answer and a different perspective on tragedy.

“It was not because of his sins or his parents’ sins,” Jesus answered. “He was born blind so the power of God could be seen in him…” Then he spit on the ground, made mud with the saliva, and smoothed the mud over the blind man’s eyes. He told him, “Go and wash in the pool of Siloam” (Siloam means sent). So the man went and washed, and came back seeing! (John 9:3, 6-7)

The disciples were looking backward for the cause, but Jesus was looking forward to all the good that would come out of it&#8230;

Sometimes our pain and our tragedies are meant to turn us back to Him. Sometimes, they point Him out to someone else who’s searching for an answer.

Sometimes the tragedy is simply an excuse for God to step in with a mighty miracle to give the world one more opportunity to believe.
