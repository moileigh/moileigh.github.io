It&#8217;s a new year. A fresh start. As I&#8217;m sitting by the fireplace warming my fingers and toes, I&#8217;m trying to decide what to do with this new year stretching out in front of me.

2017 was a great year. I celebrated ten years from my diagnosis. I wrote a book. I walked a marathon. I laughed through an inflatable 5k. I fell in love with a whole new crew of second graders. I discovered the art of making baskets and rugs out of plastic bags. I drove to the southernmost point of the Florida Keys. I baked. Not much, but I did bake.

Sadly, 2017 had some tougher moments, too. Lots of tears and some anger. Lost loved ones and severed relationships. There was a lot of sorrow and angst at work and at home in 2017.
  
But right now, as I sip my hot chocolate, and reflect on times past and times to come, I savor the peace in this moment.

That&#8217;s what I want to focus on this year.
  
Peace.
  
Peace in our hearts. Peace in our homes. Peace in our nations, in our world, in our classrooms. If we all set aside one moment every day to dwell on peace we can make our world, and our year, even better than it already is.
  
Let&#8217;s try it.
  
Wishing you and yours a peaceful 2018.
