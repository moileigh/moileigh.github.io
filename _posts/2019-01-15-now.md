God is the timekeeper

Keeping track of the minutes and seconds

That make up my time.


He chose the exact pinpoint in history

To begin my life,

And Heâ€™s chosen the second miniscule moment

That will mark the end of my journey here

And the beginning of my journey there.


I wonder how He feels

When He watches me wasting minutes,

Killing time,

Loosing seconds 

hours 

days

To trivial wasteful pursuits.


The number of my heartbeats

Has already been counted.

Can I really afford to let any more of them echo past

In unfocused waiting

Wandering

Worrying

Wasting?


I must capture each minute.

I should seize every day.

I will name each moment.


Starting with Now.
