<p><span style="color: #993300;">We celebrated Valentine&rsquo;s Day in my classroom today. I made it very clear going in that we were not having a party. We just had an icecream party last Friday and per school policy we are only supposed to have one party a month. But I did promise to give them time to pass out Valentines.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">All morning, the students took turns putting Valentines into mailboxes. There were lick-a-sticks and fruit roll-ups, blow pops, tattoos, stickers, pencils, and a bunch of other goodies. After lunch and a brief math lesson, I wrote the rules on cart paper:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #993300;">Stay in your seat.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #993300;">All treats and candy go home.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #993300;">Say, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">Then I passed out the mailboxes. Students began going through the Valentine&rsquo;s and shouting out their personalized thank yous. There were a few anonymous cards but with a little Q+A we were able to get them all identified. Everybody brought something in this year, and everybody took quite a stash home. Then they packed their bags and headed up to the library for special leaving me alone with my valentines: a pile of cards, a lollipop, a fruit rollup, some fun-dip, skittles, and a whole bunch of chocolate.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">There was a chocolate apple, a huge Hershey kiss, two heart boxes of assorted chocolates, and a chocolate rose.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">And I shouldn&rsquo;t eat any of them&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">I think this was the hardest test of my commitment yet this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">It&rsquo;s been a long, crazy couple of weeks. I&rsquo;m one day away from vacation. And I&rsquo;d love to sit on the couch binge eating my well-deserved Valentine chocolate&hellip;.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">But I didn&rsquo;t. I passed them on to my father (who gave me my love of chocolate). Then I pulled a couple of sliced bananas out of the freezer and made a huge bowl of chocolate &lsquo;icecream&rsquo; to eat while watching Dr. Who. It satisfied my cravings and tempered the temptation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">I&rsquo;m reminded yet again how hard it is if I focus on what I can&rsquo;t have and dwell on what I miss. Yes, I&rsquo;ll be craving that huge Hershey kiss as long as I&rsquo;m sitting there staring at it. It&rsquo;s so much easier to fight temptation if your hand isn&rsquo;t in the cookie jar.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">Sometimes you just need to let go and refocus. Look at what you can have. Look at what&rsquo;s right in front of you and be thankful. Life is good. Happy Valentine&rsquo;s Day!</span></p>
