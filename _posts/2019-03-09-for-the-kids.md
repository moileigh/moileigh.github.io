<p>Jesus welcomed the little children into his sphere and into his arms. He ordered his disciples not to stop them from coming to him and told them that we need to accept the kingdom of God as a child. I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of people talk about what this would mean. Many say it&rsquo;s the faith and complete trust a child brings to the world. Their willingness to accept what is said without doubting it. One author said without questioning it, but I haven&rsquo;t yet met a child who isn&rsquo;t full of questions.</p>
<p>Children are full of curiosity. They always want to know more and why and when&hellip;</p>
<p>I love that about them. Many of the adults I know have lost that questioning bent and have stopped seeking out new knowledge. They&rsquo;re tired. They&rsquo;re driven. They&rsquo;re content. But they&rsquo;re not always curious.</p>
<p>Children are also eager to please. Once they find out you like flowers, they&rsquo;re always picking them or drawing pictures of them to bring to you. They love to give you little gifts like a bracelet they made or a sticker they got. If you ask them to do something, they usually do it willingly, and they beam with joy when you give them a tidbit of praise.</p>
<p>Children are also very open about their love. They always want to hold your hand and come flying out of nowhere to give you a hug.</p>
<p>They also can be very generous.</p>
<p>On Thursday, my class read the book Beatrice&rsquo;s Goat, about a child in Uganda who received a goat from Heifer&rsquo;s International. Beatrice was nine and she really wanted to go to school but couldn&rsquo;t afford books or a uniform. When her family received the goat, they earned enough money from selling the milk that she could finally go to school. Then they sold one of the goat&rsquo;s kids and were able to put a metal roof on their house. After we read the story, we googled Beatrice. She&rsquo;s since grown up. She came to the states for college and earned her masters degree in Arizona. That little goat opened up so many opportunities for her! Then, as I do every year with my class, we went to the Heifer&rsquo;s International website to look at the animals and objects that they help provide to families in need.</p>
<p>As I was scrolling down through the animals, one of the students read out the price for a goat. $120. &ldquo;Hey &ndash; that&rsquo;s what we have!&rdquo; He shouted out. Suddenly it was like everyone was talking at once.</p>
<p>You see, last month our school had a Fun Run. Everyone in the school got sponsors to walk laps around the gym. Our class was the top earning class and the parents' group had given us a mini grant for $120 as a reward. When I asked the students what they wanted to do with the money, they suggested getting a hot tub. While I agreed that that would be very nice, I wasn&rsquo;t sure we could actually afford it. So I passed out a couple of school supply catalogs. They worked in groups to pick out what they wanted and then did the math to see if they could afford it. I have the list in my bag ready to place the orders.</p>
<p>But on Thursday, my students decided to use their money to buy something for a family who needed it more.</p>
<p>I love those little ones!</p>
<p>A teacher recently asked in the teachers&rsquo; room at work, &ldquo;Remind me again, why did I become a teacher?&rdquo; My joking reply was, &ldquo;For the money.&rdquo; The real answer though, at least for me, is so, so obvious. &lsquo;Because of the children.&rsquo;</p>
