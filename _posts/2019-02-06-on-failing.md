<p><span style="color: #333399;">A while back, I took a writing assessment for one of my classes. And I failed. It sent me on a bit of tailspin. Not just because I had failed. But because I had failed at writing. I had once been awarded the academic honors award out of my entire senior class in college. I majored in English with a concentration in writing. As an undergraduate, the editor of the Worcester Telegram and Gazette offered me a job on his newspaper. I&rsquo;d been writing poems and short stories since I&rsquo;d learned how to write a pen. I am and always have been a writer. Yet, I failed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">Obviously, the sun rose the next morning, the birds outside kept singing, I published another book, and life went on. But it was a tough couple of days as I processed it. My professor at the time wanted to fight for me and have the assessment redone. She said there was &ldquo;no way&rdquo; I could have failed it, but I asked her to let it go. Because that was a lesson I needed to learn. Like all really important lessons, it stung. And it stuck.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">I need to find my pride in my God. Not in myself. Here&rsquo;s a poem I wrote during the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">Abba</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">When did I lose You?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">When did I stop thanking You for each breath?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">When did I stop letting you carry the burdens?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&rsquo;m lost.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&rsquo;m broken.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve failed at my last strength.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I&rsquo;m finally slipping back into Your throne room.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">The prodigal daughter</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">Still covered with filth and tears.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">Help me to let go of my reputation</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">So that I can cling to Yours.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">It hurts to think that others might think of me as inadequate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">But I&rsquo;m not even phased by the thought</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">that they&rsquo;re not even thinking of You</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">Take the sting.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">Crush my pride.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">You are in control</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">And I need to accept that in all areas of my life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">Ready or not, Abba, I&rsquo;m coming to find You.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There&rsquo;s no hope without You.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There&rsquo;s no purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There&rsquo;s no joy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">I can&rsquo;t live off my pride.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">It&rsquo;s a splintered crutch that will give way painfully.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">Accolade will never satisfy</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">And I&rsquo;ll always be afraid of losing it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll never be the best.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">But I can still be the best You&rsquo;ve made me to be.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">I need to only find my self-worth</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">in the price you paid for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">A very, very high price indeed.</span></p>
