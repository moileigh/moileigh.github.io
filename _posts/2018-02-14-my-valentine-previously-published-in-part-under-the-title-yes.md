Valentine&#8217;s Day can be a tough day for some people. If you&#8217;re in a relationship, there&#8217;s pressure to get the perfect gift and go on the perfect date. If you&#8217;re not in a relationship, every ad and candy heart reminds you that you&#8217;re alone, hinting that, maybe, somehow, you&#8217;re flawed because of that aloneness.

I&#8217;m one of the many who are not in a relationship. And most of the time, that&#8217;s not a bad thing. But sometimes, like on Valentine&#8217;s Day, I start contemplating the &#8216;What if&#8217;s and &#8216;Why not&#8217;s of life.

One year, in desperation, I finally sat down and had a long talk with my Abba about it. I ended our conversation with the question, &#8220;Will You be my Valentine?&#8221; And this was His answer. I thought I&#8217;d share it with you, in case you&#8217;re looking for the perfect Valentine.

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-size: x-large;">Yes.</span>
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-size: large;">Infinite, omnipotent, stretch-my-arms-out-and-die-for-you yes.</span>
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-size: large;">I will be your <span style="font-size: x-large;">Valentine.</span></span>
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-size: small;">I invented time itself so I could spend it with you.</span>
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-size: small;">I created your heart so you could feel My love.</span>
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-size: small;">I grew mountains just so you could laugh your way up them. </span>
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I will be your Hope in this broken world.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I will be your Light in the middle of the darkest nights.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  Your Warmth through the coldest winter days.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  Your Comfort in the MRI tubes.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  Your Companion on the radiation tables.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I will ask the flowers to bloom by the side of the road to catch your eye and make you smile as you drive to work. I will cause dust and debris to travel through space and momentarily block a far off sun just to make a star twinkle when you glance up at the night sky. I will sit beside you on the airplane, and I will breathe a wind under its wings to get you safely where I want you to be. I will drop blankets of snow to cancel school and give you more time to spend with Me.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I will hold your hand in public.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  And I&#8217;ll hold your heart in private.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I&#8217;ll hold all of your fears, worries, insecurities, sadnesses, and uglies in the palm of My Almighty Hand.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I will love you every single second of your life from before your conception until after your death. When you&#8217;re happy, when you&#8217;re angry, when you&#8217;re living in denial or in sin &#8212; just as much as when you&#8217;re loving me right back as much as your human heart can understand.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I will never leave you.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I will never forsake you.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I will never turn my back.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I will never let you down.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  And I&#8217;ll wait patiently for you to come home when you turn your back on Me.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I will always understand.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I will always listen.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I will always forgive.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I will always be there &#8212; beside you, behind you, before you, within you.
</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I will love you exactly as you are, and I will do everything possible to make you more You.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I will screen your calls &#8212; blocking all unnecessary pain. I will help you carry the burdens that will bring you closer to me.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I will give you such great gifts. Everyday new mercies and blessings.
</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  With me life will be a Surprise.
</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  With me life will be Good.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I will do more for you than you could ever ask or imagine.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: left;">
  I will be your Valentine.
</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="color: #990000;">Thank you for asking.</span>
</div>
