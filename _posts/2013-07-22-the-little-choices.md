<div>
  My parents are coming back to the states on Friday, so my Uncle and I have begun the process of choosing a day to drive up to the White Mountains to disperse Grammy and Grampa’s ashes.
</div>

<div>
  We already know the place – Crawford Notch. Grammy chose it over a decade ago. Her favorite place in “our mountains” which were “the most beautiful” in the world.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  They had both chosen to be cremated and sold their burial plots before Grampa died. Grammy was adamant about not wanting any of us to feel obligated to visit her grave.
</div>

<div>
   Because she won’t be there.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  As I think about the woman she was – her grace under amazing adversity, her peace during the dying process, her faithful prayers for each of her loved ones – I can’t help thinking that I want to be like that.
</div>

<div>
  But then I look at myself and I see all of the time I waste on video games and mystery novels, the way I get caught up in getting things done and forget why I’m doing them and Who I’m doing them for. Those wondrous in-His-presence, almost-getting-the-Real-meaning-of-life, nothing-else-matters moments have become so few and so far between.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Satan shouts, “Ah, just give up. You’ll never be like her. You’re just you.”
</div>

<div>
  The Spirit whispers, “Remember, it took her a lifetime to get where she was. You’re still on the journey.”
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  And I realize again that the little choices matter as greatly as the big ones. It’s a lifetime of little choices that make you who you are.
</div>

<div>
  So today I choose to ignore the shouts and listen to the whispers. Today I’ll put down the iPad and go for a walk in the woods. I’ve got to get ready to climb that mountain…
