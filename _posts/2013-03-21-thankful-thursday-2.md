<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  Last Thursday I let go of my son. Everything else will be anticlimactic.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  But with Thoreau&#8217;s call to simplify echoing in my heart, I know there&#8217;s still more to give up.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  This week I&#8217;m choosing to give up one evening every week to do volunteer work.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  I browsed the web and explored various local organizations to find an interesting local volunteer opportunity and then chose to work with Literacy Volunteers, a program run out of a nearby library. After a five session training in April, I&#8217;ll begin mentoring an adult who&#8217;s learning to speak, read, or write English.

</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  I&#8217;m incredibly nervous &#8212; this is so out of my comfort zone.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  But that&#8217;s the whole point, isn&#8217;t it?
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  It&#8217;s not about feeling comfortable.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  We shouldn&#8217;t be stuck in our comfortable 9-to-5, work-to-gym-to-home, eat-sleep-eat-work-eat-sleep ruts. Living isn&#8217;t only about our comfort in this life. In fact, I&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;s my discomforts in this life that keep me focused on the one to come.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  We should be out there looking for ways to make other people&#8217;s lives just a tad bit more comfortable so that maybe in the process, they will see something in our lives that will point them to the Life beyond.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  Maybe it&#8217;s just smiling at a stranger when stuck in traffic, a kind word of sympathy, paying for the person behind you at the toll booth, holding open a door, or giving up an evening to hang with a new friend.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  There&#8217;s always something you can do to make your corner of the world a little bit brighter.

<span style="color: #4c1130;">By the way, I&#8217;d love to hear your ideas. Please share!</span>
