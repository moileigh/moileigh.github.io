<div style="color: #660000;">
  My world got very small last week. It was just me in my chair.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000;">
</div>

<div style="color: #990000;">
  I couldn’t move without pain, or watch TV or read books without inducing the Great Nausea. I couldn&#8217;t comprehend the letters on the page clearly enough to write. I sent the occasional text message on my phone in an attempt to stay connected with somebody, somewhere; but even glancing at my iPod sent my head spinning and my stomach rolling.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000;">
</div>

<div style="color: #990000;">
  I tried to pray – to use all this extra time to visit with my Abba – but each time I began, midsentence, mid-word, I’d discover that my mind had wandered up another spiral staircase in a different direction.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000;">
</div>

<div style="color: #990000;">
  Finally, in desperation, I squinted into the bright light of my iPod and set Pandora radio to my “This is the stuff” station. I turned the volume way down low, and set the iPod on the chairback near my head. I leaned back and closed my eyes.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000;">
</div>

<div style="color: #990000;">
  And Abba came to me.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000;">
</div>

<div style="color: #990000;">
  When I couldn’t talk to Him, my Abba talked to me. When I felt most alone, He carried me and cradled me. When I slide into those scary dark noisy MRI tubes, or get wheeled down those brightly lit white hallways into the OR, He’s in there waiting for me. He holds my family together and cares for them tenderly while I’m curled up in my chair just trying to survive the day. He’s always been there and He always will be&#8230;

  <span style="font-size: large;">He</span> is <span style="font-size: large;">Hope.</span>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-size: large;">He</span> is <span style="font-size: large;">All</span> that is <span style="font-size: large;">Faithful.</span>
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-size: large;">He</span> is <span style="font-size: large;">Love</span>.
</div>

<div style="color: #990000; text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">Abba</span>, will You be <span style="font-size: x-large;">my Valentine</span>?</span>
