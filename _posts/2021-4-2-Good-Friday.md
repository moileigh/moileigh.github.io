Good Friday  
When we remember what you did for us.

Willingly.

You could have fought back when they met you in the garden.  
Or you could have stood there calmly  
and called the angels to fight for you.

You were the Lord of all Creation  
allowing little people  
to mock and spit on you  
because you loved them.  
Because you love me.

You could have swatted them away like insects.  
You could have brought down thunder and lightning,  
earth-drenching floods and shattering quakes.

Instead you let them whip you with leather and glass.  
You let them press a thorny crown onto your forehead.  
You loved them as they laughed at you.  
You loved me as they laughed at you  
and beat you to exhaustion.

You picked up the cross  
and carried it until your physical body crumpled.

You could have left that broken body there, then.  
You could have healed it new.  
You could have cursed the crowd around you.

Instead you got up  
and stumbled to the top of the hill.  
You lay down upon the cross.  
You spoke with love as they nailed you to the beam.  
&quot;Father, forgive them.  
They don&#39;t know what they are doing.&quot;

You knew.  
You had known it was coming  
as you cried and pleaded in the garden  
asking the Father if there was any other wayâ€¦

They lifted the beam,  
dropped it onto the post,  
stepped back,  
and looked up  
at the crucified  
Son of God.

This was the only way.  
You are the only way.

Two thousand years later  
we look back  
and see that it _was_ good,  
the Friday our savior  
died for our redemption.

Though not as good  
as the Sunday that followed.
