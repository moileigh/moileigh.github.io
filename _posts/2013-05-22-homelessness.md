<div>
  I’m swinging on my porch swing, journaling and wondering what Wesley’s doing right now.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  I taught my son to be independent. But sometimes I so miss his dependence. Grampa used to tell
</div>

<div>
  Grammy that she was pushing her boys away with one hand, yet clinging to them with the other. I have such mixed feelings when watching my son grow up.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  I’m so heart-swellingly proud of the young man he’s become. But… Remember when…
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  My son’s newest endeavor is to experience what it’s like to be homeless.
</div>

<div>
  With a friend from college, he’s spending two weeks on the streets of a city an hour and a half away.
</div>

<div>
  He thought ahead. He made provisions and sought wise counsel. He prayed, planned, and prepared. He’s got a deacon at a nearby church in contact, and he’s checking in.
</div>

<div>
  But…
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  And then Abba steps in with His own ‘Remember when’s.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Hey, Moi – Remember when you were young and pregnant? When you thought you’d have to give the baby up for adoption?</i></b>
</div>

<div style="mso-outline-level: 1;">
  <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Remember that first day he spent with his dad, away from you?</i></b>
</div>

<div style="mso-outline-level: 1;">
  <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Remember that first time you put him on a bus with a complete stranger?</i></b>
</div>

<div style="mso-outline-level: 1;">
  <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Remember the day he got his license and drove off alone?</i></b>
</div>

<div style="mso-outline-level: 1;">
  <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Remember when you dropped him off at college?</i></b>
</div>

<div style="mso-outline-level: 1;">
  <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Remember just a couple of weeks ago? When you gave him back to Me?</i></b>
</div>

<div>
  <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Remember when you fell down the waterfall and woke up in My arms? </i></b>
</div>

<div>
  <b><i>I’m holding him, too. Wherever he is, wherever he goes. </i></b>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  This life is not about playing it safe, or having a good time.
</div>

<div>
  It’s not about being healthy and wealthy. It’s not even about having loved ones around you, or having a place to lay your head at night.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  It’s about getting to know the God Who loves us beyond words.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Sometimes we can’t do that from a porch swing.
</div>

<div>
  But the contented peace in this mother’s heart confirms that sometimes we can.
