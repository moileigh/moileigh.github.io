**Peace**
  
Peace is not an absence of tears.
  
Peace is not an absence of questions.
  
Peace does not mean not wondering why.
  
Peace is not an absence of pain. Peace comes in spite of pain.
  
Hand in hand with pain.
  
Because of pain.

Without the pain, without the wars, without the tragedies,
  
we wouldn’t understand the need for peace.
  
Peace is simply letting Abba into the pain.
  
Letting Him remind you that He is bigger than the pain.
  
He is bigger than even this
  
and somehow, some day, this, too, shall pass.

P – patiently
  
E – enduring,
  
A – and accepting
  
C – Christ’s
  
E – Everlasting love

**Your Turn
  
What does peace look like to you?
  
** 
  
**How would you fill out the acrostic of peace?**
