        </h3><p>Stella’s sleeping.</p>

<p>She’s lying in the library between a bookshelf and the rocking chair, with her head down on the carpet and a paw draped over her eyes. And she’s sleeping.</p>

            My Valentine (previously published in part under the title Yes)
          </a>
        </h3><p>Valentine’s Day can be a tough day for some people. If you’re in a relationship, there’s pressure to get the perfect gift and go on the perfect date. If you’re not in a relationship, every ad and candy heart reminds you that you’re alone, hinting that, maybe, somehow, you’re flawed because of that aloneness.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2018/02/03/a-story-about-a-car/">
            A Story About a Car
          </a>
        </h3><p>Mom and Dad have a friend that owns a used car dealership. They’ve bought many cars from him, so a couple of Saturdays ago, they brought me by to chat with him. I tried to describe what I wanted. I told him that I’d tried a Nissan but it was too small, and I’d tried a Jeep Grand Cherokee and found it too big. I really wasn’t happy with any car I looked at because it just wasn’t my Rav. “You want a Rav?” he asked me. “I can get you a Rav.”</p>

            Still Writing
          </a>
        </h3><p>So I’ve had a lot of people ask me what my next book will be about. I love that people expect there to be a next one. There will be – I still have so much left to say.</p>
