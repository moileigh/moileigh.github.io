    <p>It’s finished! Book three: Join Me In the Journey is finally ready to publish and will be available on Amazon in three to five business days. Here’s an except from the introduction:</p>

<p><em>As I’m sitting here writing this book, I’m wishing you were sitting here with me. Wouldn’t it be nice to chat over a cup of hot chocolate and share our thoughts on life? To give and take, and grow, together? That’s the purpose of this book. It’s a chance to share, to reflect, and to grow.</em></p>

<p><em>I wrote In His Hands to share about God’s goodness, grace, and love during my cancer journey, and to maybe take a bit of fear from the world. My second book, All Is Well, is a collection of the poems that came from that journey. After reading those books, a few people approached me and commented on my faith and how nice it was that I could have such peace.</em></p>

<p><em>This book is an invitation.</em></p>

<p><em>You can rest in His hands, too.</em></p>

<p><em>For some reason, for some purpose, God carefully crafted us to be exactly who we are. Oh, we’re not done yet. I know I have a couple of corners that He’s still scrubbing at. Maybe you do, too?</em></p>

<p><em>But here we are, cherished and unique.</em></p>

<p><em>For the next 31 days, let’s celebrate our uniqueness by reflecting on who we are, who God is, and why He made us. It’ll only take about 10 minutes a day…</em></p>

<p>So, keep an eye out on Amazon! I can’t wait to hear what you think.</p>

        <p>Sometimes we don’t get to choose. Sometimes God grabs our hands and leads us on a journey. One we may not understand. One we would not have chosen. But one that shapes, changes, and saves our lives. Because He is merciful. Because He loves us.</p>
