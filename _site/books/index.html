<h3>Join Me In the Journey</h3>
<p>
Part my story and part yours, this book is meant to be read and written in over thirty-one days.
"For some reason, for some purpose, God carefully crafted us to be exactly who we are.
We're not done yet, but here we are, cherished and unique. For the next 31 days, let's celebrate our uniqueness by reflecting on who we are, who God is, and why He made us.
It'll only take about 10 minutes a day."
