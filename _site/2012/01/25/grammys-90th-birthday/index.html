  My grandmother celebrated her 90th birthday yesterday.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  We took her out to eat &#8212; my parents, my uncle and his wife, and my son and I. As we sat around the table, eating and laughing, she was quiet (she really can&#8217;t hear much of what we&#8217;re saying), but she was smiling the whole time.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  90 years. That&#8217;s a long time! Especially when you know that she was very sickly as a child. When she was 8 years old, the doctor told her mother that she wouldn&#8217;t live to turn 9. And now she&#8217;s 90.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  Granted, her life wasn&#8217;t always an easy one &#8212; she&#8217;s a three time cancer survivor &#8212; and my grandfather wasn&#8217;t always in the best of health, from shattered bones to a weary heart. And I know it was difficult,<i> is</i> difficult, each time she lets her youngest son head off to Africa. But despite the heartache (because of it?) she&#8217;s been faithful and God has used her mightily. She raised two boys who work hard at advancing God&#8217;s kingdom here on Earth. With her husband and some friends she started the church that I still attend today. She taught countless children (and adults) in Sunday school. She wrote poems and mentored young women. And she prayed.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  I&#8217;m so grateful that doctor was wrong. Not only would I not be around without her, but my life wouldn&#8217;t be what it is without her. Sometimes I slow down and pause from my busy life just enough to almost realize how lucky I am. I look around at my peers and realize what an unfair advantage I&#8217;ve been given. I had a grandmother who prayed for me every day of my life since before I was born. What would my life have been like without that loving prayer coverage? Without that Godly guidance?
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m grateful enough.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  Actually &#8212; I know I&#8217;m not.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  But I am so grateful when I glance over at my son. I watch him navigate the world today, knowing that all of his days he&#8217;s had three generations of Faith-full women interceding for him. Yes, he will have trouble. But he&#8217;ll never face it alone. Even if he lives to be 90.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  We have been so blessed.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  Which reminds me of the promise &#8212; to whom much has been given, much is expected.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  What am I doing with this amazing gift my Abba gave me? How am I doing at meeting His expectations? Although He loves a grateful heart, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s enough.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  I know there&#8217;s nothing I can DO to get into Heaven &#8212; but there&#8217;s still plenty that I can do.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  So I&#8217;m going to.
</div>

<p><span style="color: #4c1130;">But first Iâ€™m going to pray â€“ for my grandmother. ðŸ™‚</span></p>

        <p>Sometimes we donâ€™t get to choose. Sometimes God grabs our hands and leads us on a journey. One we may not understand. One we would not have chosen. But one that shapes, changes, and saves our lives. Because He is merciful. Because He loves us.</p>
