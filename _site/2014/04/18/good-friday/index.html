    <p>Today is Good Friday for so many reasons. Itâ€™s the first day of vacation, itâ€™s an I-can-stay-in-pjâ€™s-all-day-if-i-want-to-day, and itâ€™s the day we remember that Great Sacrifice made on our behalf. Jesus, the Christ, allowed himself to be crucified for my sins so that One Day I can wear His robes of Righteousness in Joyous Eternity.</p>

<p>My second graders would be complaining about all of the capital letters I used in that paragraph. Names only, Miss Nelson. Proper nouns are names.</p>

<p>Yes, little ones, they are. But sometimes we need to emphasize the very important words.</p>

<p>Great Sacrifice, One Day, Righteousness, Joyous Eternity.</p>

<p>On the sad days, I cling to those words.</p>

<p>On the happy days, I dance in the unfathomable knowledge that that day will be even better than this oneâ€¦</p>

<p>And this one is pretty good.</p>

<p>My book is all formatted and off with a friend of a friend for its final edit. Itâ€™s Almost Done!</p>

<p>Iâ€™m on vacation, resting, refreshing, and gearing up for the last leg of the 2013-2014 school year.</p>

<p>And, Iâ€™m checking out airline prices to book a trip. Weâ€™re still praying about it, but it looks like Iâ€™m going to swing out to Africa and help bring my parents home. ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>Please pray with me for the logistics of the trip â€“ that the details fall into place, that the journey goes safely, that I can wait patientlyâ€¦ Oh, and pray about the book, too. Itâ€™s been a long time in the making. Iâ€™m excited to be at this stage. Almost seven years since diagnosis! Iâ€™ve said it before, and it hope I never stop saying it: Thank You for walking this path with me.</p>

<p>Be sure you also take a moment to walk with the One Who gave His All for You today.</p>

        <p>Sometimes we donâ€™t get to choose. Sometimes God grabs our hands and leads us on a journey. One we may not understand. One we would not have chosen. But one that shapes, changes, and saves our lives. Because He is merciful. Because He loves us.</p>
