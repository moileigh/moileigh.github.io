    <p>On the road again.</p>

<p>Yes, I had to type that. :-). I’m sitting on the porch swing of kabin 4 at the Unadilla KOA. My sleeping bag is rolled, my car is packed, and I’m ready to take off for day two. As soon as I figure out which direction to turn from the driveway.</p>

<p>Day one is always the simplest – I just get into my car and drive until I can’t go any further. I got a late start yesterday so I really didn’t make it too far.</p>

<p>But yesterday was still a Big Day.</p>

<p>A friend from the C.S. Lewis society pointed me in the direction of the Booklovers’ Gourmet – a beautiful little coffee and book shop in Webster. Mom and I drove out there yesterday and the owner agreed to sell my book on consignment. My little book is now on an actual store bookshelf. Stop by and get a picture of it for me (if you do, post it to In His Hands on Facebook — hey, while you’re at it, post a picture of yourself reading my book, too!).</p>

<p>Save the date — on Saturday, October 18th I’ll be doing a book reading/signing at the Booklovers’ Gourmet. Be sure to come. I’m hoping to have my second book (All Is Well: Poems From the Detour) available by then. That’s one of my tasks for this road trip – I’m planning to retype and format two poems a night. I did meet quota last night.</p>

<p>So, I’m going to post this, then get on with the journey.</p>

<p>Thanks again for traveling with me.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear from some of you — what ‘detours’ has God brought you along lately?</p>
