    <p>Iâ€™m back at ICA, sitting on a screened-in porch of house #7 on the upper campus. Itâ€™s called Village Baptiste now, and thereâ€™s a university using many of the buildings. When we passed by this morning, Muslim praying echoed from one of the old elementary classrooms. Thereâ€™s also a poured concrete wall all around the campus.</p>

<p>We left Torogo around six oâ€™clock and drove down to Bouake in the dark. Although itâ€™s rather like a video game â€“ dodging lane-width potholes at 110 kilometers an hour â€“ there is much less traffic at night. There were many police checks on the road, but most of the guards were hesitant to leave their warm campfires, so they just opened the barrier and waved us through. We arrived on campus around 9:30, and were welcomed with a delicious meal of rice and peanut sauce. This morning we explored the campus, then walked around the wall, down to the marigot. Itâ€™s a rest day.</p>

<p>At what felt like the last minute, Mom got all of the PEDEBE books corrected and archived. There are copies in different discs and memory cards which have been strategically distributed so that the books will never have to be retyped again. She also passed out more than 500 copies of the audio bible in several different languages. We gave one to the groundskeeper at ICA today. Heâ€™s a pastor (most of the pastors here need to take on other jobs), and was very grateful for the sd card with the bible in French and Jula. He said it was a gift from God which would be very helpful.</p>

<p>Many people have asked me if Iâ€™ll come out to take Mom and Dadâ€™s place here. Thereâ€™s certainly going to be a gap left by their absence. This past term was filled with relationships. Everyone at the church calls them Papa and Maman â€“ and I was adopted quickly as a sister. Although ready to go home and be with friends and family in the states, I can tell that Mom and Dad are already plotting out their next journey back to this continent.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s hard not to. Itâ€™s hard to think about leaving this country forever. Yes, I will come back â€“ not sure when, but I will come back. ðŸ™‚</p>

        <p>Sometimes we donâ€™t get to choose. Sometimes God grabs our hands and leads us on a journey. One we may not understand. One we would not have chosen. But one that shapes, changes, and saves our lives. Because He is merciful. Because He loves us.</p>
