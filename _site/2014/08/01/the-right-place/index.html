    <p>It’s been a great road trip – but I’m slowing down. Today I’ll spend some time by the pool, and do a load of laundry. Have a late lunch at Denny’s, then head toward Houston. Tomorrow I’ll reconnect with a dear friend and spend a couple of days laughing and eating chocolate. Then Ry will point himself toward home and chug his fastest, dodging grasshoppers and raindrops all the way.</p>

<p>Did you know that it’s only 25 and a half hours from Houston to Charlton? Add in a few naps, bathroom breaks, and gas fill ups and I should be home by Thursday.</p>

<p>I’ve tremendously enjoyed this trip.</p>

<p>I’ve tremendously enjoyed this summer – a month ago I was riding a mototaxi in Korogo, Cote D’Ivoire! Not quite as comfy as my RAV, but many less grasshoppers.</p>

<p>A month from now I’ll be back in my classroom with my new crew of little ones to love and guide. Last year was a very difficult year – the kind of year that leaves you reconsidering your goals in life. This summer has been a chance to do that. A chance to realize and reaffirm that, yes, I am in the right place. At least for right now. And that’s all we really need to know, right? That we’re in the right place right now.</p>

<p>Enjoy your today!</p>
