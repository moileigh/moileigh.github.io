  Happy New Year!
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  I realize that I’m a little late posting my New Year’s resolutions. Most people have already broken theirs by now. But I wanted to be sure this year. I wanted to come up with something fabulous and truly life changing. After all, according to my long-ago teenage self, this is the year I turn “really, really old.” I need to make it count.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  While Christmas shopping, I bought myself a Fitbit bracelet. I’ve been tracking my calories (consumed and destroyed) as well as exercising daily. I’ve been walking more and I even hit my fitbit’s goal of 10,000 steps three days in a row (the first time was in the Dairy Queen parking lot heading to my car after savoring a hot fudge Sunday. I almost turned around to go back in and celebrate!).
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  A friend posted on Facebook that she was going to do The Daniel Plan. Always looking for an excuse to buy another book, I got onto Amazon and placed an order. The last package (you need to spend $35 to get free shipping, so you can’t just buy one book) arrived yesterday, and this morning I plopped down on the couch and read the first three chapters.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  Yup. There’s a New Year’s resolution in there somewhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>And it’s a big one. I suggest you read it…
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  So here it is. This year, in 2014, I want to become healthy in all realms of my life: physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  It’s going to be a lot of work, and I won’t be able to do it on my own. But My God wants to see me succeed even more than I do. And then, there’s always all of you, right?
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  <span style="font-family: Wingdings; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-char-type: symbol; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-symbol-font-family: Wingdings;"></span>
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  <span style="font-family: Wingdings;"></span>
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  <span style="font-family: Wingdings;"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Wingdings;"></span></span>
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  So today’s task was to sit down and figure out: What does spiritually, emotionally, mentally, and physically healthy look like?
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  Hmm. Well, here goes. To me being healthy means that my bills are paid, I’m fully connected with family and friends, my house is clean (to my standards, perhaps not my Grandmother’s), my sink is not overflowing with dirty dishes, and the laundry hamper lid can close. I escape often to meet my Savior in the woods, or down by the lake. I do my job well, am an appropriate weight, and have clothes that fit me nicely. I’m able to climb the occasional mountain and do jump and jacks with my students. I have mental clarity, and can make decisions quickly and confidently. My hair is healthy, my nails are painted, my heartburn is under control. My teeth are clean and my breath smells nice; my feet and back don’t hurt. I don’t worry about opinions, don’t hide in my hermit cave, and I don’t pursue reconstruction procedures because I feel that I ought to but I take the brave steps that my heart longs to. I laugh daily, giggle occasionally, and my soul is filled to the brim with a gentle joy and His quiet peace.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  And there it is. My New Year’s resolution.
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
</div>

<div style="color: #741b47;">
  <span style="font-size: large;">I’m going to strive to become the Me He created me to be.</span>
</div>

<div style="color: #741b47;">
</div>

<div style="color: #4c1130;">
  So here’s my question for you. What does healthy look like in you?

        <p>Sometimes we don’t get to choose. Sometimes God grabs our hands and leads us on a journey. One we may not understand. One we would not have chosen. But one that shapes, changes, and saves our lives. Because He is merciful. Because He loves us.</p>
